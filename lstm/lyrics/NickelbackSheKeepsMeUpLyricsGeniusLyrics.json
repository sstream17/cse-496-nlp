    "Comments": [
        "In an interview with Mike Kroeger (bassist of Nickelback), he noted the misconception that many people assume the lyrics are sexual innuendo, but he freely states that the song is about cocaine use.",
        "The song represents a change of pace for Nickelback:",
        "“Up ‘til now we’ve always just tried to be heavier with the rock songs and more melodic with the melodic songs, and now it’s, 'OK, not everything has to be left and right. Why can’t we go forward and back a little bit?’” Chad Kroeger (lead singer of Nickelback) explained to Billboard magazine. “So we tried to get a little funky.”"
