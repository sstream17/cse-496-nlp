            "[Verse 1]",
            "I went out on the town with a friend last weekend",
            "His ex-girlfriend's friend was there alone",
            "She bought a couple rounds and I got the feeling",

            "Still a little down home, there was never a doubt",
            "She's got a fast car, hotter than a dance bar",
            "Looking like a rock star, she'll be the talk of the town",
