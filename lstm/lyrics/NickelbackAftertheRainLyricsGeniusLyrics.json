        "In life I think we often lose sight that our most challenging trials and tribulations can also be our most teachable moments.  The very hardships that we encounter aren?t really obstacles at all.  Rather, they are seeds that if planted properly will bear fruit that we can learn, grow and benefit from to be the very best versions of ourselves that we can be. And that is the message I wanted to get across in ?After the Rain?.",
