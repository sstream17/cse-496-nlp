        "Nickelback’s breakout single and probably still their biggest song. It hit #1 at the Hot 100 for four weeks and ended as the top song of 2002 after 22 weeks in the Top 10.",
        "In an interview with MTV, Nickelback’s lead singer Chad Kroeger said that he wrote the song about his old girlfriend Jodi, who he had a rather dysfunctional relationship with. He kept the lyrics very ambiguous, however, which accounts for much of the song’s success, as many people could relate to an ex who started pointing out all of your faults at the same time and caused considerable heartbreak: “This time I’m mistaken, for handing you a heart worth breaking.” Silver Side Up was Nickelback’s third album, and many of the songs were about relationships and personal issues.",
        "According to an MTV article from 2009, the song was spun more than 1.2 million times on radio between 2001 to the end of 2009."
