        "Frontman and lyricist Chad Kroeger told MTV News that this track was the starting point for Dark Horse. He explained: “That was the first song we worked on for the record. We were in Sweden and went over a bunch of material with our producer, Mutt Lange, and he wanted to get to a rocker. I’ve got this phrase: ‘You look so much cuter with something in your mouth.’ He thought that was perfect and was like, ‘Let’s start with that one right there.’ So we just went off and just wrote this silly rock song that’s got this great groove to it, and away we went.”"
