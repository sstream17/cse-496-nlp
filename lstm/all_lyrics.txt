When it's obvious that you bore me ENDTOKEN
I'm not worried, 'cause it's five minutes to your glory ENDTOKEN
Well, I'm drowning in your ocean ENDTOKEN

Packed pretty tight in here tonight ENDTOKEN

I could use a little muscle to get what I need ENDTOKEN
I'll drink a fifth of Jack and scream out "She's with me" ENDTOKEN
A couple of sounds that I really like ENDTOKEN
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike ENDTOKEN
I'm a juvenile product of the working class ENDTOKEN
Whose best friend floats from the bottom of a glass ENDTOKEN

I reside in 209, you're in 208 ENDTOKEN
You moved in last Friday night ENDTOKEN
And I just couldn't wait ENDTOKEN
So I tried to call across the hall ENDTOKEN
To ask you out someday ENDTOKEN
But a lineup formed outside your door, and I was way too late ENDTOKEN
Well, I'd rather start off slow ENDTOKEN
This whole thing's like some sort of race ENDTOKEN
Instead of winning what I want, I'm sitting here in second place ENDTOKEN
Because somewhere, the one I wanna be with's with somebody else ENDTOKEN
Oh God, I wanna be that someone that you're with ENDTOKEN
(I wanna be that someone that you're with) ENDTOKEN
And I can talk about it all day long 'till I run out of breath ENDTOKEN
But I still wanna be that someone that you're with ENDTOKEN
(I've got to be that someone that you're with) ENDTOKEN
And I'm pacing by the phone ENDTOKEN
'Cause I hate to be alone ENDTOKEN
And if you're out there with him somewhere and just about to kiss ENDTOKEN
God, I wanna be that someone that you're with ENDTOKEN
Well, I hear your favorite songs you sing along with everyday ENDTOKEN
And I borrow things that I don't need for conversation sake ENDTOKEN
Last night I heard your key, it hit your lock at 4 AM ENDTOKEN
Instead of being out with me, you must be out with them ENDTOKEN
Well, I'd rather start off slow ENDTOKEN
This whole thing's like some sort of race ENDTOKEN
Instead of winning what I want, I'm sitting here in second place ENDTOKEN
Because somewhere, the one I wanna be with's with somebody else ENDTOKEN
Oh God, I wanna be that someone that you're with ENDTOKEN

I wanna do it 'til the sun comes up ENDTOKEN
'Til we're both so good and sweaty we can't stand up ENDTOKEN
I wanna do it till we're both about to drop ENDTOKEN
As long as we're caught in together then we're never gonna stop ENDTOKEN
I wanna go until the neighbors all complain ENDTOKEN
'Cause they heard somebody screaming and they think we're both in pain ENDTOKEN
I wanna go so long your parents think you died ENDTOKEN
Theyâ€™re gonna call the cops, the CIA, and then the FBI ENDTOKEN
Yeah, we're gonna love it when the lights go down ENDTOKEN

(Up and down we go) ENDTOKEN
Yeah, we're getting ready for the next go 'round ENDTOKEN
'Round and 'round we go ENDTOKEN
Shut the windows, lock the doors, unplug the phone ENDTOKEN
For all intents and purposes, there ain't nobody home ENDTOKEN
Then we can do it till the batteries are gone ENDTOKEN
And borrow two from the TV remote to throw this thing back on ENDTOKEN
I wanna cover you with jello in the tub ENDTOKEN
We can roll around for hours without ever coming up ENDTOKEN
I want you naked with your favorite heels on ENDTOKEN
Slap John Deere across my ass and ride me up and down the lawn ENDTOKEN
Yeah, we're gonna love it when the lights go down ENDTOKEN

Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind ENDTOKEN
And try to take the path less traveled by ENDTOKEN
That first step you take is the longest stride ENDTOKEN
(What if, what if?) ENDTOKEN
If today was your last day ENDTOKEN
And tomorrow was too late ENDTOKEN
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?) ENDTOKEN
Would you live each moment like your last? ENDTOKEN
Leave old pictures in the past? ENDTOKEN
Donate every dime you have? ENDTOKEN
(What if, what if?) ENDTOKEN
If today was your last day ENDTOKEN
(What if, what if?) ENDTOKEN
(If today was your last day) ENDTOKEN
Against the grain should be a way of life ENDTOKEN
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight ENDTOKEN
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try ENDTOKEN
So live like you'll never live it twice ENDTOKEN
Don't take the free ride in your own life ENDTOKEN
(What if, what if?) ENDTOKEN
If today was your last day ENDTOKEN

Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?) ENDTOKEN

Swear up and down to God above ENDTOKEN
That you finally fall in love? (That you finally fall in love) ENDTOKEN
If today was your last day ENDTOKEN
If today was your last day ENDTOKEN
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart? ENDTOKEN
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars ENDTOKEN
Regardless of who you are ENDTOKEN
So do whatever it takes (Takes) ENDTOKEN
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life ENDTOKEN

I got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track ENDTOKEN
I'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride ENDTOKEN
'Cause the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight ENDTOKEN
I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out ENDTOKEN
I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run ENDTOKEN
Your mom don't know that you were missing ENDTOKEN
She'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you that I've been kissing ENDTOKEN
Screamin' ENDTOKEN
No, we're never gonna quit ENDTOKEN
Ain't nothing wrong with it ENDTOKEN
Just acting like we're animals (Animals) ENDTOKEN
No, no matter where we go ENDTOKEN
'Cause everybody knows ENDTOKEN
We're just a couple of animals (Animals) ENDTOKEN
So come on baby, get in ENDTOKEN
Get in, just get in ENDTOKEN
Check out the trouble we're in ENDTOKEN
You're beside me on the seat ENDTOKEN
Got your hand between my knees ENDTOKEN
And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze ENDTOKEN
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear ENDTOKEN
But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears ENDTOKEN
By now, no doubt that we were heading south ENDTOKEN
I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth ENDTOKEN
'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch ENDTOKEN
It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch ENDTOKEN
I'm screamin' ENDTOKEN
No, we're never gonna quit ENDTOKEN
Ain't nothing wrong with it ENDTOKEN
Just acting like we're animals (Animals) ENDTOKEN
No, no matter where we go ENDTOKEN
'Cause everybody knows ENDTOKEN
We're just a couple of animals (Animals) ENDTOKEN
So come on baby, get in ENDTOKEN
Get in, just get in ENDTOKEN
Look at the trouble we're in ENDTOKEN
We were parked out by the tracks ENDTOKEN
We're sitting in the back and we just started getting busy ENDTOKEN
When she whispered "What was that?" ENDTOKEN
"The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are" ENDTOKEN
And that was when she started screamin' ENDTOKEN
"That's my dad outside the car!" ENDTOKEN
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition ENDTOKEN
Must have wound up on the floor while we were switching our positions ENDTOKEN
I guess they knew that she was missing ENDTOKEN
As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing ENDTOKEN
Screamin' ENDTOKEN
No, we're never gonna quit ENDTOKEN
Ain't nothing wrong with it ENDTOKEN
Just acting like we're animals (Animals) ENDTOKEN
No, no matter where we go ENDTOKEN
'Cause everybody knows ENDTOKEN
We're just a couple of animals (Animals) ENDTOKEN
So come on baby, get in ENDTOKEN
(We're just a couple of animals) ENDTOKEN
Get in, just get in ENDTOKEN
Ain't nothing wrong with it ENDTOKEN
Check out the trouble we're in ENDTOKEN
(We're just a couple of animals) ENDTOKEN
Get in, just get in ENDTOKEN
All men with stars upon the chest ENDTOKEN
Save yourselves, your families ENDTOKEN
Don't worry about the rest ENDTOKEN
Small child receives light through the crack ENDTOKEN
The human mile, they're never coming back ENDTOKEN
Hold out your hand and ask for some ENDTOKEN
Now and again, she sits beneath the tree ENDTOKEN
The sign above reads ENDTOKEN
"Hard Work Will Set You Free" ENDTOKEN
Hold out your hand and ask for some ENDTOKEN
Hold out your hand and ask for some ENDTOKEN
Too late for another direction ENDTOKEN
Always what we've got in store ENDTOKEN
Hurry back; we've all been waiting ENDTOKEN

A childless mother ENDTOKEN
Leave it except for ENDTOKEN
Leave it except for one ENDTOKEN
Hold out your hand and ask for some ENDTOKEN

Hold out your hand and ask for ENDTOKEN
Hold out your hand and ask for ENDTOKEN
Hold out your hand and ask for some ENDTOKEN
How could this affect my life? ENDTOKEN
How could I affect the outcome? ENDTOKEN
So why even try; for what, for what, for what, for what? ENDTOKEN
A coward can save the day ENDTOKEN
When the bravest of men just stand by ENDTOKEN
So easy to say; so what, so what, so what? ENDTOKEN
So what if we all stand up? ENDTOKEN
What if we don't give in? ENDTOKEN
What if we traded all complacency for a voice that won't be ignored? ENDTOKEN
How can we just give up? ENDTOKEN
How can we just give in? ENDTOKEN
What if the silent majority wasn't silent anymore? ENDTOKEN
A candle's the smallest light ENDTOKEN
But a handful becomes a lighthouse ENDTOKEN
Cutting the night for us, for us, for us, for us ENDTOKEN
The one with the loudest voice is rarely the one to follow ENDTOKEN
Silence the noise; so what, so what, so what? ENDTOKEN
So what if we all stand up? ENDTOKEN
What if we don't give in? ENDTOKEN
What if we traded all complacency for a voice that won't be ignored? ENDTOKEN
How can we just give up? ENDTOKEN
How can we just give in? ENDTOKEN

Two men ENDTOKEN
They started walking ENDTOKEN
Started talking about better days ENDTOKEN
One says to the other ENDTOKEN
We do it all again ENDTOKEN
Seems I knew I would ENDTOKEN
And now I found it ENDTOKEN
Found I adored it ENDTOKEN
I didn't want this ENDTOKEN
Somebody help me see ENDTOKEN
Now I feel it ENDTOKEN
Feel like I've been there ENDTOKEN
I didn't need this ENDTOKEN
Somebody help me breathe ENDTOKEN
Here we are again ENDTOKEN
Just face to facing ENDTOKEN
Each other another day ENDTOKEN
Who wins? ENDTOKEN
Well, who cares ENDTOKEN
It always ends up the same ENDTOKEN
Seems I knew I would ENDTOKEN
And now I found it ENDTOKEN
Found I adored it ENDTOKEN
I didn't want this ENDTOKEN
Somebody help me see ENDTOKEN
And now I feel it ENDTOKEN
Feel that I've been there ENDTOKEN
I didn't need this ENDTOKEN
Would somebody help me stand? ENDTOKEN
And now I've told them ENDTOKEN
Already warned them ENDTOKEN
I didn't want this ENDTOKEN
Somebody help me breathe ENDTOKEN
If I was them ENDTOKEN
Then I wanna be ENDTOKEN
What I see ENDTOKEN
If I could drag my life in a moment ENDTOKEN
Wanna know, do you want me to go? ENDTOKEN
Going to keep it all from ending ENDTOKEN
Never stop myself from pretending ENDTOKEN
That you always knew that I never could ENDTOKEN
All I ever really wanted was to be the same ENDTOKEN
Equal treatment never ever comes ENDTOKEN
And there they go again ENDTOKEN
All I ever really wanted was to be like you ENDTOKEN
So perfect ENDTOKEN
So worthless ENDTOKEN
If I could take it all back think again ENDTOKEN
I would ENDTOKEN
And now I found it ENDTOKEN
Found I adored it ENDTOKEN

Children all have saviors ENDTOKEN
Children don't care who saves us ENDTOKEN
Round the corner, round the bend ENDTOKEN
Fingernails torn to the end ENDTOKEN
Bring back, bring back ENDTOKEN
Bring back, bring back on me ENDTOKEN
On me ENDTOKEN
I told them, we scold them ENDTOKEN
Can't console them always ENDTOKEN
Toy soldiers falling ENDTOKEN
Dominoes, but who knows? ENDTOKEN
Bring back, bring back ENDTOKEN

And tokes for all my friends ENDTOKEN
And I will live forever ENDTOKEN
Yeah and I dream of all I'm worth ENDTOKEN
And all along the way ENDTOKEN
And I will never even ENDTOKEN
Yeah and I will coast through falling prayers ENDTOKEN
And all along the way ENDTOKEN
And I will always listen ENDTOKEN

Bring back, bring back (Or) ENDTOKEN
Bring back, bring back (We) ENDTOKEN
On me ENDTOKEN
Bring it back, bring it back on ENDTOKEN
Bring it back, bring it back on ENDTOKEN
Bring it back, bring it back on ENDTOKEN
I missed you so much that I begged you to fly and see me ENDTOKEN
You must've broke down 'cause you finally said that you would ENDTOKEN
But now that you're here, I just feel like I'm constantly dreaming ENDTOKEN
'Cause something's gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good ENDTOKEN
For 48 hours, I don't think that we left my hotel room ENDTOKEN
Should show you the sights 'cause I'm sure that I said that I would ENDTOKEN
We gotta make love just one last time in the shower ENDTOKEN
Well, something's gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good ENDTOKEN
And it's like, every time I turn around ENDTOKEN
I fall in love and find my heart face down and ENDTOKEN
Where it lands is where it should ENDTOKEN
This time it's like ENDTOKEN
The two of us should probably start to fight ENDTOKEN
'Cause something's gotta go wrong, 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good, oh ENDTOKEN
Feelin' way too damn good ENDTOKEN
Sometimes I think best if left in the memory ENDTOKEN
It's better kept inside than left for good ENDTOKEN
Looking back each time they tried to tell me ENDTOKEN
'Cause something's gotta go wrong, 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good, oh ENDTOKEN
And it's like, every time I turn around ENDTOKEN
I fall in love and find my heart face down and ENDTOKEN
Where it lands is where it should ENDTOKEN
This time it's like ENDTOKEN
The two of us should probably start to fight ENDTOKEN
'Cause something's gotta go wrong, 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good, oh, oh ENDTOKEN

Feelin' way too damn good ENDTOKEN
(I missed you so much that I begged you to fly and see me) ENDTOKEN
Feelin' way too damn good ENDTOKEN
(I missed you so much that I begged you to fly and see me) ENDTOKEN
Yes, he wore a cowboy hat ENDTOKEN
Each bone broken in his back ENDTOKEN
All the money and all the gold ENDTOKEN
Couldn't buy my love at eight years old ENDTOKEN
Now I'm in love with a girl that's wrong for me ENDTOKEN
Ask her, she will disagree ENDTOKEN
Her father was a small town man ENDTOKEN
With small time dreams and small town hands ENDTOKEN
But... ENDTOKEN
But I was there when there was nobody home ENDTOKEN
Please believe me when I say, I don't know ENDTOKEN
Gone for good in fact, but what does it mean? ENDTOKEN
Within a year, they always sold them, but.. ENDTOKEN
Easy enough to just look at her ENDTOKEN
Whole world on a silver platter ENDTOKEN
What's that? Is that bad for me? ENDTOKEN
If I would set her conscience free ENDTOKEN
Won round one, but it's not over ENDTOKEN
He don't care cause he didn't know her ENDTOKEN
Too long it's not the same ENDTOKEN
If I could lend a hand in shame ENDTOKEN
But I was there when there was nobody home ENDTOKEN
Please believe me when I say, I don't know ENDTOKEN
Gone for good in fact, but what does it mean? ENDTOKEN
Within a year, they always sold them, but... ENDTOKEN
You'll always be ENDTOKEN
So much easier to see ENDTOKEN
Don't hide from me ENDTOKEN
That which I've already seen ENDTOKEN
You lie to me ENDTOKEN
More than occasionally ENDTOKEN
Don't lie to me ENDTOKEN
You lied to me ENDTOKEN
I'm as high as I'll ever be ENDTOKEN
I don't mind, stay and see ENDTOKEN
They've all gone, why don't we? ENDTOKEN
Lonely as you and me ENDTOKEN
But I'm as high as I'll ever be ENDTOKEN
Later on, last to see ENDTOKEN
My past is gone, only from me ENDTOKEN
I'm alive ENDTOKEN
But I was there when there was nobody home ENDTOKEN
Please believe me when I say, I don't know ENDTOKEN
Gone for good in fact, but what does it mean? ENDTOKEN
Within a year, they always sold them, but... ENDTOKEN
Remember when it was me ENDTOKEN
Driving has come down just for me ENDTOKEN
And then we'll try as we've been ENDTOKEN
Left on an eastbound train, gone first thing this morning ENDTOKEN
Why's what's best for you, always the worst thing for me? ENDTOKEN
When am I gonna learn? Why? 'Cause I'm tired of hating ENDTOKEN
When will it be your turn? Why? 'Cause I'm tired of waiting ENDTOKEN
No, I don't, no I don't, no I don't ENDTOKEN
Well no, I don't find faith in your forced feelings ENDTOKEN
Not fooled by your misleadings ENDTOKEN
Won't buy this line your selling ENDTOKEN
Tired of this lie your telling ENDTOKEN
I won't, I don't, no, I won't do this anymore ENDTOKEN
I won't, I don't, no, I won't do this anymore ENDTOKEN
She says I'm only tellin' half of it ENDTOKEN
That's probably because there's only half worth tellin' ENDTOKEN
And every time I try to laugh it off ENDTOKEN
That's when you turn around and wind up yellin' ENDTOKEN
When am I gonna learn? Why? 'Cause I'm tired of hating ENDTOKEN
When will it be your turn? Why? 'Cause I'm tired of waiting ENDTOKEN
No, I don't, no I don't, no I don't ENDTOKEN

He was my best friend ENDTOKEN
Well, I tried to help him ENDTOKEN
But he traded everything for suffering ENDTOKEN
And found himself alone ENDTOKEN
I watched the lying turn into hiding ENDTOKEN
With scars on both his lips, his fingertips were melted to the bone ENDTOKEN
But I can still remember what his face looked like ENDTOKEN
When I found him in an alley in the middle of the night ENDTOKEN
Tell me what you know, tell me what you gone and done now ENDTOKEN
Tell me what you know, tell me what you gone and done now ENDTOKEN
A gun would do the trick, get it over with ENDTOKEN
You're better off ENDTOKEN
To take all you've got and burn it on the spot ENDTOKEN
To get high-igh-igh-igh (high-igh-igh-igh) ENDTOKEN
Three days no sleeping ENDTOKEN
Well, he gave up eating ENDTOKEN
He sold his mother's rings, she said nothing ENDTOKEN
And pretended not to know ENDTOKEN
He started stealing to supply the feeling ENDTOKEN
Found out he pulled a knife on someone's wife ENDTOKEN
And held it to her throat ENDTOKEN
But I can still remember what his face looked like ENDTOKEN
When I found him in an alley in the middle of the night ENDTOKEN
Tell me what you know, tell me what you gone and done now ENDTOKEN
Tell me what you know, tell me what you gone and done now ENDTOKEN
A gun would do the trick, get it over with ENDTOKEN
You're better off ENDTOKEN
To take all you've got and burn it on the spot ENDTOKEN
To get high-igh-igh-igh (high-igh-igh-igh) ENDTOKEN
Tell me what you did, where you gone and hid? ENDTOKEN
Show me is what you really want, watching what you've got ENDTOKEN
Slowly ENDTOKEN
Circling the drain, throw it all away ENDTOKEN
Just to get high-igh-igh-igh (high-igh-igh-igh) ENDTOKEN
High-igh, ohhh! ENDTOKEN
(High-igh-igh-igh, high-igh-igh-igh) ENDTOKEN

Circling the drain, throw it all away ENDTOKEN
Just to get high-igh-igh-igh ENDTOKEN
Got a criminal record, I can't cross state lines ENDTOKEN
First on the bad list, and you're last on mine ENDTOKEN
Lookin' for a scapegoat, long past due ENDTOKEN
Walking down the aisle, staring straight at you ENDTOKEN
I still hear him screaming "Where do I hide?" ENDTOKEN
And he asks and I say "Hurry inside" ENDTOKEN
He said, she said, no she don't ENDTOKEN
Be back before morning, You know she won't ENDTOKEN
I remember that summer, like yesterday ENDTOKEN
And I remember his mother, as he was dragged away ENDTOKEN
I still hear him screaming "Where do I hide?" ENDTOKEN
And he asks and I say "Hurry inside" ENDTOKEN
A whole lot of memories, yours and not mine ENDTOKEN
And he asks and I say "Hurry inside" ENDTOKEN
Got a criminal record, I can't cross state lines ENDTOKEN

A whole lot of memories, yours and not mine ENDTOKEN
And he asks and I say "Hurry inside" ENDTOKEN
"Where do I hide?" ENDTOKEN
I paid my last respects this mornin' on an early grave ENDTOKEN
Already said goodbye, nothin' left to say ENDTOKEN
A tiny church a tiny town and not a tear was spent ENDTOKEN
Not how I wanted it, I'm hating all of this ENDTOKEN
Well, I'm hating, all of this ENDTOKEN
I'm hating, all of this ENDTOKEN
All of this, all of this ENDTOKEN
Now I know why, I hide my love from you somedays ENDTOKEN
No, I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me ENDTOKEN
You came along, and tore this wall down around me ENDTOKEN
Looks like you found me ENDTOKEN
Now I know why ENDTOKEN
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning ENDTOKEN
I've been a loser all my life, I'm not about to change ENDTOKEN
If you don't like it, there's the door, nobody made you stay ENDTOKEN
There ain't a woman on the planet who can deal with it ENDTOKEN
Just how I wanted it, I'm hating all of this ENDTOKEN
Well, I'm hating, all of this ENDTOKEN

Never made it as a wise man ENDTOKEN
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing ENDTOKEN
Tired of living like a blind man ENDTOKEN
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling ENDTOKEN
And this is how you remind me ENDTOKEN
This is how you remind me of what I really am ENDTOKEN
This is how you remind me of what I really am ENDTOKEN
It's not like you to say sorry ENDTOKEN
I was waiting on a different story ENDTOKEN
This time I'm mistaken ENDTOKEN
For handing you a heart worth breaking ENDTOKEN
And I've been wrong, I've been down ENDTOKEN
Been to the bottom of every bottle ENDTOKEN
These five words in my head ENDTOKEN
Scream "Are we having fun yet?" ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no ENDTOKEN

I know it's late, but something's on my mind ENDTOKEN
It couldn't wait, there's never any time ENDTOKEN
'Cause life slips by without a warning ENDTOKEN
And I'm tired of ignoring ENDTOKEN
All the space that's between you and I ENDTOKEN
Let's lock the door behind us ENDTOKEN
They won't find us ENDTOKEN
Make the whole world wait ENDTOKEN

Now I know just what that really means ENDTOKEN
Let's lock the door behind us ENDTOKEN
They won't find us ENDTOKEN

So we can stay ENDTOKEN
Inside this atmosphere ENDTOKEN
Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite) ENDTOKEN

What I'm looking for ENDTOKEN
Where the good times gone? ENDTOKEN
Where the good times gone? ENDTOKEN
All the stupid fun ENDTOKEN

Out in the back in the old corn field ENDTOKEN
Underneath the tractor wheel ENDTOKEN

It ain't carved of stone or made of wood ENDTOKEN
And if you paid for it, then it ain't no good ENDTOKEN
And you still won't know ENDTOKEN
What I'm looking for ENDTOKEN
Oh, where the good times gone? ENDTOKEN

We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall ENDTOKEN
Cheech and Chong probably woulda' smoked them all ENDTOKEN

Just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon ENDTOKEN
Landlord says I should buy a tent ENDTOKEN

I just love being with my friends ENDTOKEN
We barely get by, but have the best times ENDTOKEN
And hope it never ends ENDTOKEN
We drink all day till we fall down ENDTOKEN
So we can do it all again ENDTOKEN
It's not the human walk ENDTOKEN
It's the human race ENDTOKEN
If you ain't livin' on the edge ENDTOKEN
You're takin' too much space ENDTOKEN

Weâ€™ll need the gloves, weâ€™ll need the bags, a couple masks ENDTOKEN
Weâ€™ll need to steal a car with windows tinted black ENDTOKEN

A freshly stolen Mustang small block 302 ENDTOKEN
Drove past the bank a dozen times this afternoon ENDTOKEN
The only parking spot was half a block away ENDTOKEN
Gave us time to practice just exactly what to say ENDTOKEN
Screamin'... ENDTOKEN
This is a robbery now, get down on the floor ENDTOKEN
Weâ€™re here for all the shit that you donâ€™t need no more (Yeah) ENDTOKEN

Get â€˜em up ENDTOKEN
There I was, laid out on a table ENDTOKEN
Screamin' sweat and bare feet to the floor ENDTOKEN
In my life, I'd not soften ENDTOKEN
Things that cut, and burn so often ENDTOKEN
But I sit, think of somethin' ENDTOKEN
Scared to face, the dyin' nothin' ENDTOKEN
See the cycle I've waited for ENDTOKEN
It ain't like that anymore ENDTOKEN
Where I go is when I feel I'm able ENDTOKEN
How I fight is why I'm feelin' sore ENDTOKEN
In my Mind, not forgotten ENDTOKEN
Feel as though, a tooth were rotten ENDTOKEN
Behind the smile, a tongue that's slippin' ENDTOKEN
Buzzards cry, when flesh is rippin' ENDTOKEN
See the cycle I've waited for ENDTOKEN
It ain't like that anymore ENDTOKEN
Here I sit writing on the paper ENDTOKEN
Trying to think of words you can't ignore ENDTOKEN
In my eyes, what I'm lacking ENDTOKEN
Score at face, a ten for slacking ENDTOKEN
Sign the deal, set in motion ENDTOKEN
Smaller fish, so huge the ocean ENDTOKEN
See the cycle I've waited for ENDTOKEN
It ain't like that anymore ENDTOKEN
This time, this place ENDTOKEN
Misused, mistakes ENDTOKEN
Too long, too late ENDTOKEN
Who was I to make you wait? ENDTOKEN
Just one chance, just one breath ENDTOKEN
Just in case there's just one left ENDTOKEN
'Cause you know ENDTOKEN
You know, you know ENDTOKEN
I love you ENDTOKEN
I loved you all along ENDTOKEN
And I miss you ENDTOKEN
Been far away for far too long ENDTOKEN
I keep dreaming you'll be with me ENDTOKEN
And you'll never go ENDTOKEN
Stop breathing ENDTOKEN
If I don't see you anymore ENDTOKEN
On my knees, I'll ask ENDTOKEN
Last chance for one last dance ENDTOKEN
'Cause with you, I'd withstand ENDTOKEN
All of Hell to hold your hand ENDTOKEN
I'd give it all, I'd give for us ENDTOKEN
Give anything, but I won't give up ENDTOKEN
'Cause you know ENDTOKEN
You know, you know ENDTOKEN
I love you ENDTOKEN
I loved you all along ENDTOKEN
And I miss you ENDTOKEN
Been far away for far too long ENDTOKEN
I keep dreaming you'll be with me ENDTOKEN
And you'll never go ENDTOKEN
Stop breathing ENDTOKEN
If I don't see you anymore ENDTOKEN
So far away (So far away) ENDTOKEN
Been far away for far too long ENDTOKEN
So far away (So far away) ENDTOKEN
Been far away for far too long ENDTOKEN
But you know ENDTOKEN
You know, you know ENDTOKEN
I wanted ENDTOKEN
I wanted you to stay ENDTOKEN
'Cause I needed ENDTOKEN
I need to hear you say ENDTOKEN
That I love you (I love you) ENDTOKEN
I loved you all along ENDTOKEN
And I forgive you (I forgive you) ENDTOKEN
For being away for far too long ENDTOKEN
So keep breathing ENDTOKEN
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore ENDTOKEN
Believe it ENDTOKEN
Hold on to me, and never let me go ENDTOKEN
Keep breathing ENDTOKEN
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore ENDTOKEN
Believe it ENDTOKEN
Hold on to me, never let me go ENDTOKEN
Keep breathing ENDTOKEN
Hold on to me, never let me go ENDTOKEN
Keep breathing ENDTOKEN
Hold on to me, never let me go ENDTOKEN
You call to me, and I fall at your feet ENDTOKEN
How could anyone ask for more? ENDTOKEN
(How could anyone ask for more?) ENDTOKEN
And our time apart, like knives in my heart ENDTOKEN
How could anyone ask for more? ENDTOKEN
(How could anyone ask for more?) ENDTOKEN
But if there's a pill to help me forget ENDTOKEN
God knows I haven't found it yet ENDTOKEN
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to ENDTOKEN
'Cause trying not to love you, only goes so far ENDTOKEN
And trying not to need you, is tearing me apart ENDTOKEN
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor ENDTOKEN
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for ENDTOKEN
'Cause trying not to love you ENDTOKEN
Only makes me love you more ENDTOKEN
Only makes me love you more ENDTOKEN
And this kind of pain, only time takes away ENDTOKEN
That's why it's harder to let you go (That's why it's harder to let you go) ENDTOKEN
And nothing I can do, without thinking of you ENDTOKEN
That's why it's harder to let you go (That's why it's harder to let you go) ENDTOKEN
But if there's a pill to help me forget ENDTOKEN
God knows I haven't found it yet ENDTOKEN
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to ENDTOKEN
'Cause trying not to love you, only goes so far ENDTOKEN
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart ENDTOKEN
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor ENDTOKEN
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for ENDTOKEN
'Cause trying not to love you ENDTOKEN
Only makes me love you more ENDTOKEN
So I sit here divided, just talking to myself ENDTOKEN
Was it something that I did? Was there somebody else? ENDTOKEN
When a voice from behind me, that was fighting back tears ENDTOKEN
Sat right down beside me, whispered right in my ear ENDTOKEN
Said, I've been dying to tell you ENDTOKEN
Trying not to love you, only went so far ENDTOKEN
Trying not to need you, was tearing me apart ENDTOKEN
Now I see the silver lining, from what we're fighting for ENDTOKEN
We just keep on trying, we could be much more ENDTOKEN
'Cause trying not to love you ENDTOKEN
Oh, yeah, trying not to love you ENDTOKEN
Only makes me love you more ENDTOKEN
Only makes me love you more ENDTOKEN
Bribing me, we come, we watched how ENDTOKEN
We're last to throw our pennies ENDTOKEN
A passive tramps lifts her skirt ENDTOKEN
And asks us then we throw them down to her ENDTOKEN
And I know why I will always follow you ENDTOKEN
Anywhere my brother leads me to ENDTOKEN
We don't want to live in the sun ENDTOKEN
Just to keep them happy for a while ENDTOKEN
Midnight, and Frank freaks out and reaches God and ENDTOKEN
Fairly tied up too ENDTOKEN
But I know why I will always follow you ENDTOKEN
Anywhere my brother leads me to ENDTOKEN
And I remember wanting to be you ENDTOKEN
And pray to God that we would all pull through ENDTOKEN
'Cause I know why I will always follow you ENDTOKEN
If you're my brother, then I will follow you ENDTOKEN
Lifelong friends threw bottle ends ENDTOKEN
And yell in the air like lifelong enemies ENDTOKEN
Who's stronger, who's lived longer? ENDTOKEN
World quarrels and grand kids on your knee ENDTOKEN
'Cause I know I will always follow ENDTOKEN
Anywhere my brother leads me to ENDTOKEN
And I remember wanting to be you ENDTOKEN
And pray to God that we would all pull through ENDTOKEN
Cause I know why I will always follow you ENDTOKEN
If you're my brother, then I will follow you ENDTOKEN
'Cause I know why I will always follow ENDTOKEN
I will follow you and I will ENDTOKEN
I know why I will always follow ENDTOKEN
I will follow you and I will ENDTOKEN
Have I gone all too far? ENDTOKEN
Have I been here before? ENDTOKEN
If I have, let me know ENDTOKEN
How it goes ENDTOKEN
Take her place ENDTOKEN
And I will ENDTOKEN
See her face ENDTOKEN
No reason ENDTOKEN
Let it slide ENDTOKEN
And I will ENDTOKEN
Watch her die ENDTOKEN
To run through fields ENDTOKEN
To find, and I will ENDTOKEN
Hold, then lead, then lie ENDTOKEN
And I will, no I won't ENDTOKEN
Is it now really time? ENDTOKEN
Can I just give mine? ENDTOKEN
If I can simply trade ENDTOKEN
Deal made ENDTOKEN
Take her place ENDTOKEN
And I will ENDTOKEN
See her face ENDTOKEN
No reason ENDTOKEN
Let it slide ENDTOKEN
And I will ENDTOKEN
Watch her die ENDTOKEN
To run through fields ENDTOKEN
To find, and I will ENDTOKEN
Hold, then lead, then lie ENDTOKEN
And I will, no I won't ENDTOKEN
Run, hide away from me ENDTOKEN
Desouled, to seek, decide ENDTOKEN
And I will, no I won't ENDTOKEN
Run through fields to find ENDTOKEN
Hold then lead, then lie ENDTOKEN
And I will ENDTOKEN
Away from me ENDTOKEN
Run, desouled, and ENDTOKEN
Hold, to heal, to find ENDTOKEN
And I can't ENDTOKEN
Run through fields to find ENDTOKEN
Hold then lead, then lie ENDTOKEN
And I will ENDTOKEN
Away from me ENDTOKEN
Run, desouled, and ENDTOKEN
Hold, to heal, to find ENDTOKEN
No I won't ENDTOKEN
Forever's a lonely time and the dogs aren't always ENDTOKEN
Aren't always on my mind ENDTOKEN
'Cause I didn't free them ENDTOKEN
The scenery is burning me 'cause I'm still in it ENDTOKEN
So why don't you free me ENDTOKEN
'Cause its not my business ENDTOKEN
What he's done to me ENDTOKEN
Control is all you really need ENDTOKEN
And I can't believe it ENDTOKEN
I can't believe that ENDTOKEN
You didn't see me ENDTOKEN
Passing glances fall on me ENDTOKEN
Like screams on deaf ears ENDTOKEN
They're all laughing at me ENDTOKEN
With encouraging cheers ENDTOKEN
What he's done to me ENDTOKEN
Control is all you really need ENDTOKEN
And I can't believe it ENDTOKEN
I can't believe that ENDTOKEN
You wouldn't free me ENDTOKEN
Why don't you see me? ENDTOKEN
Why don't you free me? ENDTOKEN
I can't believe that ENDTOKEN
You don't believe me ENDTOKEN
I guess I had it comin' ENDTOKEN
My fault for not runnin' ENDTOKEN
I just dressed too tempting ENDTOKEN
'Cause your heads fuckin empty ENDTOKEN
And I can't believe it ENDTOKEN
I can't believe that you didn't see me ENDTOKEN
This time, I wonder what it feels like ENDTOKEN
To find the one in this life ENDTOKEN
The one we all dream of ENDTOKEN
But dreams just aren't enough ENDTOKEN
So I'll be waiting for the real thing ENDTOKEN
I'll know it by the feeling ENDTOKEN
The moment when we're meeting ENDTOKEN
Will play out like a scene ENDTOKEN
Straight off the silver screen ENDTOKEN
So I'll be holding my breath ENDTOKEN
Right up 'til the end ENDTOKEN
Until that moment when ENDTOKEN
I find the one that I'll spend forever with ENDTOKEN
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there ENDTOKEN
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares ENDTOKEN
Someone to love with my life in their hands ENDTOKEN
There's gotta be somebody for me like that ENDTOKEN
'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own) ENDTOKEN
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone) ENDTOKEN
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere) ENDTOKEN
There's gotta be somebody for me out there ENDTOKEN
Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight ENDTOKEN
And dammit, this feels too right ENDTOKEN
It's just like dÃ©ja vu, me standing here with you ENDTOKEN
So I'll be holding my breath ENDTOKEN
Could this be the end? ENDTOKEN
Is it that moment when ENDTOKEN
I find the one that I'll spend forever with? ENDTOKEN
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there ENDTOKEN
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares ENDTOKEN
Someone to love with my life in their hands ENDTOKEN
There's gotta be somebody for me like that ENDTOKEN
'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own) ENDTOKEN
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone) ENDTOKEN
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere) ENDTOKEN
There's gotta be somebody for me out there ENDTOKEN
Ooh, you can't give up (When you're looking for) ENDTOKEN
A diamond in the rough ('Cause you never know) ENDTOKEN
When it shows up (Make sure you're holding on) ENDTOKEN
'Cause it could be the one ENDTOKEN
The one you're waiting on ENDTOKEN
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there ENDTOKEN
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares ENDTOKEN
Someone to love with my life in their hands ENDTOKEN
There's gotta be somebody for me, oh ENDTOKEN
Nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own) ENDTOKEN
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone) ENDTOKEN
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere) ENDTOKEN
There's gotta be somebody for me out there ENDTOKEN
Nobody wants to be the last one there (When you're looking for) ENDTOKEN
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares ('Cause you never know) ENDTOKEN
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (Make sure you're holding on) ENDTOKEN
There's gotta be somebody for me out there ENDTOKEN
Just one more moment, that's all that's needed ENDTOKEN
Like wounded soldiers in need of healing ENDTOKEN
Time to be honest, this time I'm pleading ENDTOKEN
Please don't dwell on it, 'cause I didn't mean it ENDTOKEN
I canâ€™t believe I said I'd lay our love on the ground ENDTOKEN
But it doesn't matter 'cause I've made it up, forgive me now ENDTOKEN
Every day I spend away, my soul's inside out ENDTOKEN
Gotta be some way that I can make it up to you now, somehow ENDTOKEN
By now you'd know that I'd come for you ENDTOKEN
No one but you, yes, I'd come for you ENDTOKEN
But only if you told me to ENDTOKEN
And I'd fight for you ENDTOKEN
I'd lie, it's true ENDTOKEN
Give my life for you ENDTOKEN
You know I'd always come for you ENDTOKEN
I was blindfolded, but now I'm seeing ENDTOKEN
My mind was closing, now I'm believing ENDTOKEN
I finally know just what it means to let someone in ENDTOKEN
To see the side of me that no one does or ever will ENDTOKEN
So if you're ever lost and find yourself all alone ENDTOKEN
I'd search forever just to bring you home ENDTOKEN
Here and now, this I vow ENDTOKEN
By now you'd know that I'd come for you ENDTOKEN
No one but you, yes, I'd come for you ENDTOKEN
But only if you told me to ENDTOKEN
And I'd fight for you ENDTOKEN
I'd lie, it's true ENDTOKEN
Give my life for you ENDTOKEN
You know I'd always come for you ENDTOKEN
You know I'd always come for you ENDTOKEN
No matter what gets in my way ENDTOKEN
As long as there's still life in me ENDTOKEN
No matter what, remember you know I'll always come for you ENDTOKEN
Yes, I'd come for you, no one but you ENDTOKEN
Yes, I'd come for you ENDTOKEN
But only if you told me to ENDTOKEN
And I'd fight for you ENDTOKEN
I'd lie, it's true ENDTOKEN
Give my life for you ENDTOKEN
You know I'd always come for you ENDTOKEN
No matter what gets in my way ENDTOKEN
As long as there's still life in me ENDTOKEN
No matter what, remember you know I'll always come for you ENDTOKEN
I'd crawl across this world for you ENDTOKEN
Do anything you want me to ENDTOKEN
No matter what, remember you know I'll always come for you ENDTOKEN
You know I'll always come for you ENDTOKEN
I went out on the town with a friend last weekend ENDTOKEN
His ex-girlfriend's friend was there alone ENDTOKEN
She bought a couple rounds and I got the feeling ENDTOKEN
She could really handle alcohol ENDTOKEN
Another one down and headed off the deep end ENDTOKEN
The more we drank, the less that we had on ENDTOKEN
And it turns out she's got everything I want, all rolled into one ENDTOKEN
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo ENDTOKEN
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt ENDTOKEN
She's got a fast car, hotter than a dance bar ENDTOKEN
Looking like a rock star, she'll be the talk of the town ENDTOKEN
You know, she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one ENDTOKEN
Gotta get me some ENDTOKEN
God almighty, look at that body ENDTOKEN
Flickers like a sticker on a new Ferrari ENDTOKEN
She's a scene from a Baywatch rerun ENDTOKEN
Hotter than a barrel on a squeezed machine gun ENDTOKEN
Well, she can get lower than a Maserati ENDTOKEN
Never seen somebody move that way ENDTOKEN
Everywhere she goes there's an instant party ENDTOKEN
Everybody wants to know her name ENDTOKEN
And it turns out she's got everything I want, all rolled into one ENDTOKEN
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo ENDTOKEN
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt ENDTOKEN
She's got a fast car, hotter than a dance bar ENDTOKEN
Looking like a rock star, and she likes to go out and ENDTOKEN
Get her hands on ENDTOKEN
Anything to stand on ENDTOKEN
Anything to dance on ENDTOKEN
And she'd be swinging around ENDTOKEN
Under the hot lights, underneath the spotlight ENDTOKEN
Even going all night ENDTOKEN
She'll be the talk of the town, you know ENDTOKEN
She's got everything I want, but all rolled into one ENDTOKEN
Gotta get me some ENDTOKEN
God almighty, look at that body ENDTOKEN
Flickers like a sticker on a new Ferrari ENDTOKEN

She's got everything I want, but all rolled into one ENDTOKEN
Gotta get me some ENDTOKEN
I gotta get me some ENDTOKEN
Gotta get me some ENDTOKEN
Please don't be too long while you're gone ENDTOKEN
There ain't enough to keep me here too long ENDTOKEN
Not like the last time I stood in line ENDTOKEN
Just enough to keep me bouncing off the walls, yeah ENDTOKEN
The new day, the new tray that comes around ENDTOKEN
Pills and all, enough to kill him while he sleeps ENDTOKEN
Is this the alley we drag him to? ENDTOKEN
Just off of Hollywood and Normandy ENDTOKEN
If it worked like she said it would ENDTOKEN
Just like living in Hollywood ENDTOKEN
Just like a bad dream, or so it seems ENDTOKEN
Just like I'm back in emergency ENDTOKEN
If it worked like she said it would ENDTOKEN
Just like living in Hollywood ENDTOKEN
Just like a bad dream, or so it seems ENDTOKEN
Just like I'm back in emergency ENDTOKEN

Just like living in Hollywood ENDTOKEN
Just like a bad dream, or so it seems ENDTOKEN
Just like I'm back in emergency ENDTOKEN
Tell your friends not to think aloud ENDTOKEN
Until they swallow ENDTOKEN
Whisper things into my brain ENDTOKEN
Your voice sounds so hollow ENDTOKEN
I am not a leader of men ENDTOKEN
Since I prefer to follow ENDTOKEN
Do you think I could have a drink ENDTOKEN
Since it's so hard to swallow? ENDTOKEN
So hard to swallow ENDTOKEN
So turn the television off ENDTOKEN
And I will sing a song ENDTOKEN
And if you suddenly have the urge ENDTOKEN
You can sing along ENDTOKEN
I touch your hand, I touch your face ENDTOKEN
I think the fruit is rotten ENDTOKEN
Give me lessons on how to breathe ENDTOKEN
Because I think I've forgotten ENDTOKEN
I think I've forgotten ENDTOKEN
One day, out to a cliff ENDTOKEN
That overlooks the water ENDTOKEN
I jumped in to save a girl ENDTOKEN
It was somebody's daughter ENDTOKEN
And now the ring that's on my hand ENDTOKEN
It was given to me by her ENDTOKEN
And to this day we all sit around ENDTOKEN
And dream of ways to get higher ENDTOKEN
To get much higher ENDTOKEN
Tell your friends not to think aloud ENDTOKEN
Until they swallow ENDTOKEN
Whisper things into my brain ENDTOKEN
Your voice sounds so hollow ENDTOKEN
I am not a leader of men ENDTOKEN
Since I prefer to follow ENDTOKEN
Do you think I could have a drink ENDTOKEN
Since it's so hard to swallow? ENDTOKEN
So hard to swallow ENDTOKEN
Got to meet the hottie with the million dollar body ENDTOKEN
They say itâ€™s over budget, but you'd pay her just to touch it, come on ENDTOKEN
Needs to hit the big screen and shoot a little love scene ENDTOKEN
If Hollywood had called her, she'd be gone before you hollered, come on ENDTOKEN
Dirty little lady with the pretty pink thong ENDTOKEN
Every sugar daddy hitting on her all night long ENDTOKEN
Doesn't care about the money, she could be with anybody ENDTOKEN
Ain't it funny how the honey wanted you all along ENDTOKEN
(You naughty thing) ENDTOKEN
Youâ€™re ripping up the dance floor, honey ENDTOKEN
(You naughty woman) ENDTOKEN
You shake your ass around for everyone ENDTOKEN
(Youâ€™re such a mover) ENDTOKEN
I love the way you dance with anybody ENDTOKEN
(The way you swing) ENDTOKEN
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb ENDTOKEN
Youâ€™re so much cooler when you never pull it out ENDTOKEN
'Cause you look so much cuter with something in your mouth ENDTOKEN
Crafty little lip tricks ENDTOKEN
Tattoos on her left hip ENDTOKEN
She bending as youâ€™re spending ENDTOKEN
Thereâ€™s no end to it, so baby, come on ENDTOKEN
Dressed up like a princess ENDTOKEN
Betting that her skin smells better ENDTOKEN
Than the scent of every flower in the desert, come on ENDTOKEN
Dirty little lady with the pretty pink thong ENDTOKEN
Every sugar daddy hitting on her all night long ENDTOKEN
Doesn't care about the money, she could be with anybody ENDTOKEN

Youâ€™re so much cooler when you never pull it out ENDTOKEN
'Cause you look so much cuter with something in your mouth ENDTOKEN
She loves the night scene bar queen ENDTOKEN
Living for the fun taking over every dance floor like she's the only one ENDTOKEN
In the spotlight all night dissing everyone ENDTOKEN
And trying to look so innocent while sucking on her thumb ENDTOKEN
(Youâ€™re so much cooler) When you never pull it out ENDTOKEN
(So much cuter) With something in your mouth ENDTOKEN
(You naughty thing) ENDTOKEN
Youâ€™re ripping up the dance floor, honey ENDTOKEN
(You naughty woman) ENDTOKEN

'Cause you look so much cuter with something in your... ENDTOKEN
One more depending on a prayer ENDTOKEN
And we all look away ENDTOKEN
People pretending everywhere ENDTOKEN
It's just another day ENDTOKEN
There's bullets flying through the air ENDTOKEN
And they still carry on ENDTOKEN
We watch it happen over there ENDTOKEN
And then just turn it off ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
We must stand together ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
There's no giving in ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
Hand in hand forever ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
That's when we all win ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
That's, that's, that's when we all win ENDTOKEN
That's, that's, that's when we all win ENDTOKEN
They tell us everything's alright ENDTOKEN
And we just go along ENDTOKEN
How can we fall asleep at night ENDTOKEN
When something's clearly wrong? ENDTOKEN
When we could feed a starving world ENDTOKEN
With what we throw away ENDTOKEN
But all we serve are empty words ENDTOKEN
That always taste the same ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
We must stand together ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
There's no giving in ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
Hand in hand forever ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
That's when we all win ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
That's, that's, that's when we all win ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
That's, that's, that's when we all win ENDTOKEN
The right thing to guide us ENDTOKEN
Is right here inside us ENDTOKEN
No one can divide us ENDTOKEN
When the light is nearly gone ENDTOKEN
But just like a heartbeat ENDTOKEN
The drumbeat carries on ENDTOKEN
And the drumbeat carries on ENDTOKEN
Just like a heartbeat ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
We must stand together ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
There's no giving in ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN

That's, that's, that's when we all win ENDTOKEN
I can taste the color of the lights ENDTOKEN
Take one of those and two of these ENDTOKEN
Then watch the walls begin to breathe ENDTOKEN
I can taste the color of the lights ENDTOKEN
Wings are growing out of me ENDTOKEN
The floor is floating underneath ENDTOKEN
I can see the future burning bright ENDTOKEN
Future burning bright ENDTOKEN
The ceiling has us mesmerized ENDTOKEN
It feels like we could never die ENDTOKEN
Heading for the dark side of the moon ENDTOKEN
As we lift off into the sky ENDTOKEN
Invincible and so alive ENDTOKEN
Ten feet tall and fucking bulletproof ENDTOKEN
Insanity is setting in ENDTOKEN
Reality is getting thin ENDTOKEN
The universe just started slowing down ENDTOKEN
Yet suddenly we're traveling ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
We're going a million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
When shadows soon start breaking free ENDTOKEN
No longer held by gravity ENDTOKEN
(How did we get so far from the ground?) ENDTOKEN
Speaking to the galaxy ENDTOKEN
Received and sending back to me ENDTOKEN
I can finally hear the speed of sound ENDTOKEN
Speed of fucking sound ENDTOKEN
I like this everlasting pill ENDTOKEN
'Cause time itself is standing still ENDTOKEN
Why's the room still spinning just the same? ENDTOKEN
Turn off your phone so no one calls ENDTOKEN
'Cause you and I are tripping balls ENDTOKEN
I can still hear ringing in my brain ENDTOKEN
Insanity is setting in ENDTOKEN
Reality is getting thin ENDTOKEN
See no signs of ever coming down ENDTOKEN
Yet suddenly we're traveling ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
We're going a million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
Insanity is setting in ENDTOKEN
Reality is getting thin ENDTOKEN
The particles are dancing all around ENDTOKEN
I can't deny the hardest thing for me ENDTOKEN
Is finding time to finally breathe ENDTOKEN
See no signs of ever coming down ENDTOKEN
Another wave is coming in ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
We're going a million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
And some say ENDTOKEN
Why you follow if somethings so long? ENDTOKEN
So I asked him ENDTOKEN
And he convinced me before long ENDTOKEN
Now it's over ENDTOKEN
And I've seen him, don't come back anymore ENDTOKEN
And he said ENDTOKEN
I need ENDTOKEN
I don't ask much anymore ENDTOKEN
I found ENDTOKEN
I found something, yeah ENDTOKEN
Throw a stone into the water ENDTOKEN
The ripple is broke ENDTOKEN
Burn them, baby ENDTOKEN
Just for holding the candle too close ENDTOKEN
Take it all back ENDTOKEN
Search for justice, don't live there anymore ENDTOKEN
And he said ENDTOKEN
I need ENDTOKEN
I don't ask much anymore ENDTOKEN
I found ENDTOKEN
I found something, yeah ENDTOKEN
And why do you see me in this way? ENDTOKEN
The way that I did ENDTOKEN
I gave him the means to the ends ENDTOKEN
Yes, I did ENDTOKEN
I bothered not to believe in this way ENDTOKEN
The way that I did ENDTOKEN
I made him just to see in this way ENDTOKEN
The way that I did ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah ENDTOKEN
I need ENDTOKEN
I don't ask much anymore ENDTOKEN
I found ENDTOKEN
I found something, yeah ENDTOKEN
Fathers hands were lined with dirt ENDTOKEN
From long days in the field ENDTOKEN
And mothers hands are serving meals ENDTOKEN
In a cafÃ© on Main Street ENDTOKEN
With mouths to feed ENDTOKEN
Just trying to keep clothing on our backs ENDTOKEN
And all I hear about ENDTOKEN
Is how it's so bad, it's so bad ENDTOKEN
It's too bad, it's stupid ENDTOKEN
Too late, so wrong, so long ENDTOKEN
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind ENDTOKEN
Let's walk, let's talk ENDTOKEN
(Let's talk) ENDTOKEN
You left without saying goodbye ENDTOKEN
Although I'm sure you tried ENDTOKEN
You call the house from time to time ENDTOKEN
To make sure we're alive ENDTOKEN
But you weren't there ENDTOKEN
Right when I needed you the most ENDTOKEN
And now I dream about it ENDTOKEN
And how it's so bad, it's so bad ENDTOKEN
It's too bad, it's stupid ENDTOKEN
Too late, so wrong, so long ENDTOKEN
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind ENDTOKEN
Let's walk, let's talk ENDTOKEN
Let's talk ENDTOKEN
It's too bad, it's stupid ENDTOKEN
Too late, so wrong, so long ENDTOKEN
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind ENDTOKEN
Let's walk, let's talk ENDTOKEN
Father's hands are lined with guilt ENDTOKEN
For tearing us apart ENDTOKEN
Guess it turned out in the end ENDTOKEN
Just look at where we are ENDTOKEN
We made it out ENDTOKEN
We still got clothing on our backs ENDTOKEN
And now I scream about it ENDTOKEN
And how it's so bad, it's so bad ENDTOKEN
It's too bad, it's stupid ENDTOKEN
Too late, so wrong, so long ENDTOKEN
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind ENDTOKEN
Let's walk, let's talk ENDTOKEN
It's too bad, it's stupid ENDTOKEN
Too late, so wrong, so long ENDTOKEN
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind ENDTOKEN
Let's walk, let's talk ENDTOKEN
Long time, let's walk, let's talk ENDTOKEN
Hey ENDTOKEN
Who's coming with me, to kick a hole in the sky? ENDTOKEN
I love the whiskey, let's drink that shit till it's dry ENDTOKEN
So grab a Jim Beam, JD, whatever you need ENDTOKEN
Have a shot from the bottle, doesn't matter to me ENDTOKEN
Another round, fill her up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up ENDTOKEN
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down ENDTOKEN
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out (Bottoms up) ENDTOKEN
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up ENDTOKEN
Drinking every drop until it all runs out ENDTOKEN
Another round, fill her up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up ENDTOKEN
Ooh, bottoms up ENDTOKEN
So grab your best friends and make your way to the bar ENDTOKEN
But keep your distance, we're gonna light it on fire ENDTOKEN
We're drinking black tooth, 80 proof, straight gasoline ENDTOKEN
Slam as much as you can take and hand the bottle to me ENDTOKEN
Another round, fill her up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up ENDTOKEN
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down ENDTOKEN

Drinking every drop until it all runs out ENDTOKEN
Another round, fill her up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up ENDTOKEN
Another round, fill her up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up ENDTOKEN
Hey, bottoms up ENDTOKEN
Not like I need to depend upon anyone ENDTOKEN
Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all ENDTOKEN
One more anthem for the know it all ENDTOKEN
I won't be standing up for long ENDTOKEN
I better learn how to crawl ENDTOKEN
Learn how to crawl ENDTOKEN
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor ENDTOKEN
Like I need to defend my own innocence ENDTOKEN
So what, I did it, I admit it, and I'm pleading the 5th ENDTOKEN
One more anthem for the know it all ENDTOKEN
I won't be standing up for long ENDTOKEN
I better learn how to crawl ENDTOKEN
Learn how to crawl ENDTOKEN
In ten minutes, I'll be laying out flat on the floor ENDTOKEN
Eight minutes from losing it a little bit ENDTOKEN
Five minutes, your description might be starting to fit ENDTOKEN
Three to go and I'm forgetting all that I've ever known ENDTOKEN
I won't be standing up for long ENDTOKEN
I better learn how to crawl ENDTOKEN
Not like I need to depend upon anyone ENDTOKEN
Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all ENDTOKEN

Can't see nothing at all ENDTOKEN
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor ENDTOKEN
Well, it's midnight, damn right, we're wound up too tight ENDTOKEN

I got a fist full of fifties, tequila just hit me ENDTOKEN
Oh ENDTOKEN
We got no class, no taste, no shirt, and shit faced ENDTOKEN
We got it lined up, shot down, firing back straight crown ENDTOKEN
We're going out tonight (Hey!) ENDTOKEN
To kick out every light (Hey!) ENDTOKEN
Take anything we want (Hey!) ENDTOKEN
Drink everything in sight (Hey!) ENDTOKEN
We're going till the world stops turning ENDTOKEN

The Devil went down to Georgia ENDTOKEN
He was lookin' for a soul to steal ENDTOKEN
He was in a bind the way behind and willing to make a deal ENDTOKEN
When he came across this young man pickin' a guitar and playin' it hot ENDTOKEN
The Devil jumped up on a hickory stump and said, "Boy, let me tell you what." ENDTOKEN
"I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a guitar player, too ENDTOKEN
And if you'd care to take this dare I'll make a bet with you ENDTOKEN
Now you a pretty damn good strummer, boy, but give the Devil his due ENDTOKEN
I'll bet a guitar of gold against your soul that says I'm better than you" ENDTOKEN
But the boy said, "My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin ENDTOKEN
But I'll take your bet; you're gonna regret, I'm the best there's ever been." ENDTOKEN
The Devil opened up his case and he said, "I'll start this show." ENDTOKEN
And fire flew from his fingertips as he tuned his axe down low ENDTOKEN
And he pulled that pick across the strings and it made an evil hiss ENDTOKEN
Then a band of demons all joined in and it sounded just like this ENDTOKEN
When the Devil finished, Johnny said, "Well, you're pretty good, old son ENDTOKEN
Well sit your old ass in that chair right there, let me show you how the fuck it's done." ENDTOKEN
The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat ENDTOKEN
And he laid that gold guitar down on the ground at Johnny's feet ENDTOKEN
But Johnny said, "Devil, just come on back, if you ever wanna try again ENDTOKEN
I done told you once, you son of a bitch, I'm the best that's ever been." ENDTOKEN
Wake up ENDTOKEN
My baby still looks amazing with no makeup ENDTOKEN
And dammit I knew the second that you came up ENDTOKEN
From underneath the covers ENDTOKEN
Said "I wanna meet your mother, your daddy, your sister and your brother" ENDTOKEN
One week, the time it took you to tell me that you love me ENDTOKEN
Packed all of my shit and moved across the country ENDTOKEN
And now we're buying diamonds ENDTOKEN
Saying it's only 20 karats, it can't be that hard to find it, baby ENDTOKEN
Your touch has made me a believer ENDTOKEN
Your love is all I ever needed ENDTOKEN
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity ENDTOKEN
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round ENDTOKEN
She takes like the sunshine kissing me ENDTOKEN
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee ENDTOKEN
And she said, "Honey, if you want to you can come with me" ENDTOKEN
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round ENDTOKEN
She takes like the sunshine kissing me ENDTOKEN
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee ENDTOKEN
And she said, "Honey, if you want to you can come with me" ENDTOKEN
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round ENDTOKEN
Out on sunset ENDTOKEN
I can't imagine that you ain't having fun yet ENDTOKEN
Baby maybe just wait cause I ain't drunk yet ENDTOKEN
As soon as I looked over ENDTOKEN
There's no way to sugarcoat it ENDTOKEN
You were busy motorboatin' on that blonde, girl ENDTOKEN
Keep up with what you doing ENDTOKEN
Ain't nothing wrong girl ENDTOKEN
Looks like we got another come along, girl ENDTOKEN
If you ain't afraid to try it ENDTOKEN
You know we'll be flying private as long as I can be the pilot, baby ENDTOKEN
Your touch has made me a believer ENDTOKEN
Your love is all I ever needed ENDTOKEN
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity ENDTOKEN
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round ENDTOKEN
She takes like the sunshine kissing me ENDTOKEN
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee ENDTOKEN
And she said, "Honey, if you want to you can come with me" ENDTOKEN
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round ENDTOKEN

(Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and) ENDTOKEN
(Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and) ENDTOKEN
(Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and) ENDTOKEN
(Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and) ENDTOKEN
Flo Rida, girl you got me runnin' round ENDTOKEN
What a perfect misses ENDTOKEN
My misses still eat McDonald's, taste delicious ENDTOKEN
Primadonna, not this one, so I guess she'll get it ENDTOKEN
Work my kisses ENDTOKEN
Work my britches ENDTOKEN
Every nickel back pays a visit ENDTOKEN
To my baby girl, my baby, yeah ENDTOKEN
Run around town on a treadmill ENDTOKEN
I ain't going nowhere ENDTOKEN
No underwear, that's what she wears ENDTOKEN
Thought a Playmate wanna join the party ENDTOKEN
She responds to me like, "Hugh Heff?" ENDTOKEN
Birthday cake, wanna grant my wishes ENDTOKEN
Every day I'm losing my breath ENDTOKEN
Can't replace that face, that waist ENDTOKEN
I'd chase this girl like Belvidere ENDTOKEN
Baby ENDTOKEN
She takes like the sunshine kissing me ENDTOKEN
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee ENDTOKEN
And she said, "Honey, if you want to you can come with me" ENDTOKEN
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round ENDTOKEN
She takes like the sunshine kissing me ENDTOKEN

Oh, oh ENDTOKEN
Oh, oh ENDTOKEN
Oh, oh ENDTOKEN
She's got me runnin' round and round ENDTOKEN
The first words that come out ENDTOKEN
And I can see this song will be about you ENDTOKEN
I can't believe that I can breathe without you ENDTOKEN
But all I need to do is carry on ENDTOKEN
The next line I write down ENDTOKEN
And there's a tear that falls between the pages ENDTOKEN
I know that pain's supposed to heal in stages ENDTOKEN
But it depends which one I'm standing on ENDTOKEN
I write lines down, then rip them up ENDTOKEN
Describing love can't be this tough ENDTOKEN
I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if ENDTOKEN
I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly ENDTOKEN
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon ENDTOKEN
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much ENDTOKEN
Unless I sing this song to you ENDTOKEN
I'm dying to show you ENDTOKEN
This could end happily ever after ENDTOKEN
There doesn't ever have to be disaster ENDTOKEN
And all you have to do is sing along ENDTOKEN
I write lines down, then rip them up ENDTOKEN
Impossible describing love ENDTOKEN
I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if ENDTOKEN
I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly ENDTOKEN
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon ENDTOKEN
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much ENDTOKEN
Unless I sing this song to you ENDTOKEN
I could set this song on fire ENDTOKEN
Sing this song to you ENDTOKEN
I could set this song on fire ENDTOKEN
Light this old guitar on fire, I'd still hear the notes ENDTOKEN
Drown the melody in water, I'd still hear its ghost ENDTOKEN
Sing it with somebody else, but we'd be out of tune ENDTOKEN
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much ENDTOKEN
I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if ENDTOKEN
I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly ENDTOKEN
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon ENDTOKEN
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much ENDTOKEN
Unless I sing this song to you ENDTOKEN
I could set this song on fire ENDTOKEN
Unless I sing this song to you ENDTOKEN
I could set this, I could set this ENDTOKEN
I wanna sing this song to you ENDTOKEN
I could set this song on fire ENDTOKEN
Sing this song to you ENDTOKEN
I could set this, I could set this ENDTOKEN
Well, you can dig me up a grave ENDTOKEN
And try and stick me in the ground ENDTOKEN
Well, you can tie me to the bed ENDTOKEN
And try and beat me half to death ENDTOKEN
But you can never keep me down ENDTOKEN
Well, you can stick me in a hole ENDTOKEN
And you can pray all day for rain ENDTOKEN
You can shoot me in the leg ENDTOKEN
Just to try to make me beg ENDTOKEN
And you can leave me there for days ENDTOKEN
And I'll stay alive ENDTOKEN
Just to follow you home, yeah ENDTOKEN
And I will survive ENDTOKEN
'Cause you're my Mississippi Princess, you're my California Queen ENDTOKEN
Like the Duchess of Detroit and every city in between ENDTOKEN
You can slap me in the face and you can scream profanity ENDTOKEN
Leave me here to die alone, but I'll still follow you home ENDTOKEN
I'll still follow you home ENDTOKEN
You can make a couple calls ENDTOKEN
And tell your brothers I'm in town ENDTOKEN
Put a bounty on my head ENDTOKEN
And tell my parents that I'm dead ENDTOKEN
And hope to hell I'm never found ENDTOKEN
You can steal me the keys ENDTOKEN
To your daddy's Cadillac ENDTOKEN
Well, you can tamper with the brakes ENDTOKEN
Call it a mistake ENDTOKEN
And pray I'm never coming back ENDTOKEN
And I'll stay alive ENDTOKEN
Just to follow you home, yeah ENDTOKEN
And I will survive ENDTOKEN
'Cause you're my Mississippi Princess, you're my California Queen ENDTOKEN
Like the Duchess of Detroit and every city in between ENDTOKEN
You can slap me in the face and you can scream profanity ENDTOKEN
Leave me here to die alone, but I'll still follow you home ENDTOKEN

Hands on the mirror, can't get much clearer ENDTOKEN
Can't make this all go away ENDTOKEN
Now that you're bleeding, you stare at the ceiling ENDTOKEN
Watch as it all fades away ENDTOKEN
From what you do, because of you ENDTOKEN
You know I can't be there ENDTOKEN
Each time that you call ENDTOKEN
I swore not to come, but I'm here after all ENDTOKEN
I know by the look that I see in your eye ENDTOKEN
I won't stand around and I won't watch you die ENDTOKEN
From what you do, because of you ENDTOKEN
What you do, what you do ENDTOKEN
What's become of you? ENDTOKEN
What you do, what you do ENDTOKEN
What's become of? ENDTOKEN
Now that you did this, you ask for forgiveness ENDTOKEN
Doctor, could you be my priest? ENDTOKEN
You say you're mistaken, but look what you've taken ENDTOKEN
You laugh as you lie through your teeth ENDTOKEN
From what you do, because of you ENDTOKEN
You know I can't be there ENDTOKEN
Each time that you call ENDTOKEN
I swore not to come, but I'm here after all ENDTOKEN
I know by the look that I see in your eye ENDTOKEN
I won't stand around and I won't watch you die ENDTOKEN

What's become of? ENDTOKEN
Climb into the ring for a battle that you can't win ENDTOKEN
Swing as hard as you can swing, it will still mean nothing ENDTOKEN
Shouldâ€™ve seen it coming, it had to happen sometime ENDTOKEN
But you went and brought a knife to an all out gun fight ENDTOKEN
And the only thing to save is the banner that you wave ENDTOKEN
To be wrapped around your grave ENDTOKEN
Youâ€™ve gone too far ENDTOKEN
Who do you think you are? ENDTOKEN
Is this what you came for? ENDTOKEN
Well, this means war ENDTOKEN
Say anything you want, but talk will get you nowhere ENDTOKEN
The only thing you've brought was psychological warfare ENDTOKEN
Well, thereâ€™s no getting out ENDTOKEN
And now you gotta wonder ENDTOKEN
Who will dig you out when youâ€™re six feet under? ENDTOKEN
And the only thing to save is the banner that you wave ENDTOKEN
To be wrapped around your grave ENDTOKEN
Youâ€™ve gone too far ENDTOKEN
Who do you think you are? ENDTOKEN
Is this what you came for? ENDTOKEN
Well, this means war ENDTOKEN

Well, this means war ENDTOKEN
Well, this means war ENDTOKEN
Cherry stem with her mouth she could tie in a knot ENDTOKEN
Favourite trick she does, one in ten that she's got ENDTOKEN
Making friends, setting trends, hardly having to try ENDTOKEN
All the looks by the book, best that money can buy ENDTOKEN
Look what your money bought ENDTOKEN
It's all that she's got ENDTOKEN
It keeps her company ENDTOKEN
Straight from Mom and Daddy ENDTOKEN
Last chance to dance, out in back of the bar ENDTOKEN
Shaking hands, nice to meet you, I don't know who you are ENDTOKEN
She has a toke and makes a joke about the alley man ENDTOKEN
Never pleasured from the treasure in a garbage can ENDTOKEN

Uncle Sam taught him to shoot, maybe a little too well ENDTOKEN
Finger on the trigger, loaded bullet ENDTOKEN
He hit the stage so full of rage And let the whole world know it ENDTOKEN
Six feet away, they heard him say "Oh God, don't let him pull it" ENDTOKEN
"Please God, don't let him pull it" ENDTOKEN
How could you put us through it? ENDTOKEN
His brother watched you do it ENDTOKEN
How could you take his life away? (What made you think you had the right?) ENDTOKEN
How could you be so full of hate? (To take away somebody's life) ENDTOKEN
And when I heard you let him die and made the world all wonder why ENDTOKEN
I sat at home and on my own, I cried alone ENDTOKEN
And scratched your name on the side of a bullet ENDTOKEN
And in the wake of his mistake So many lives are broken ENDTOKEN
Gone forever from a loaded bullet ENDTOKEN
And no excuse that you could use Could pull somebody through it ENDTOKEN
And to this day so many say, "God why'd you let him do it?" ENDTOKEN
How could you let him do it? ENDTOKEN
How could you put us through it? ENDTOKEN
His brother watched him do it ENDTOKEN

Prison gates won't open up for me ENDTOKEN
On these hands and knees, I'm crawlin' ENDTOKEN
Oh, I reach for you ENDTOKEN
Well, I'm terrified of these four walls ENDTOKEN
These iron bars can't hold my soul in ENDTOKEN
All I need is you (Come, please, I'm callin') ENDTOKEN

Say it if it's worth savin' me ENDTOKEN
Heaven's gates won't open up for me ENDTOKEN
With these broken wings I'm fallin' ENDTOKEN
All I see is you ENDTOKEN
These city walls ain't got no love for me ENDTOKEN
I'm on the ledge of the eighteenth story ENDTOKEN
Oh, I scream for you (Come, please, I'm callin') ENDTOKEN

I'm in a bar full of bikers and a handful of junkies ENDTOKEN
It's a 50-50 chance that they're planning to jump me ENDTOKEN
Anybody drinking here is lucky just to leave here alive ENDTOKEN
Oh! Well, my favorite little waitress has a hold on my eye ENDTOKEN
But there's a shotgun loaded hidden under the bar ENDTOKEN
Her finger's on the trigger if anybody gets outta line ENDTOKEN
There's other places that are better to go ENDTOKEN
But I'm addicted to the red light show ENDTOKEN
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole ENDTOKEN
And I can't get enough of the things that she does ENDTOKEN
She's gonna be, my, midnight queen ENDTOKEN
(Lock 'n' load and I'm ready to go!) ENDTOKEN
She's gonna lick, my, pistol clean ENDTOKEN
(She's got a hold on me and ain't letting go) ENDTOKEN
And I can't get enough of the things that she does ENDTOKEN
Well, she walks like a model and she talks like a trucker ENDTOKEN
Doesn't want a lollipop, but she sure loves a sucker ENDTOKEN
They're closing in around her, I'm cutting to the front of the line ENDTOKEN
Oh! She's got a bottle of Tequila and a lime for her lips ENDTOKEN
Lay that body on the bar and put that salt on her hips ENDTOKEN
I was lying when I told her that I'm only gonna lick her tonight! ENDTOKEN
There's other places that are better to go ENDTOKEN

Baby's born on a bathroom floor ENDTOKEN
Her mother prays that it'll never cry ENDTOKEN
But nothing's wrong, you've got your prom dress on ENDTOKEN
When they ask you'll say "It isn't mine" ENDTOKEN
You know they're gonna know you lied ENDTOKEN
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away? ENDTOKEN
You know they're gonna burn it down ENDTOKEN
Wash my hands of this ENDTOKEN
You notice how Dod ain't even helping you out ENDTOKEN
Wash my hands of this ENDTOKEN
You notice how God ain't even helping you ENDTOKEN
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away? ENDTOKEN
You know they're gonna burn it down ENDTOKEN
So keep the way you're feeling anonymous ENDTOKEN
And hide it all until the day you die ENDTOKEN
Your secrets safe, at least you thought it was ENDTOKEN
You can only keep it for a little while ENDTOKEN
And now you're terrified ENDTOKEN
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away? ENDTOKEN
You know they're gonna burn it down ENDTOKEN
Wash my hands of this ENDTOKEN
You notice how God ain't even helping you out ENDTOKEN
Wash my hands of this ENDTOKEN

Baby's born on a bathroom floor ENDTOKEN
Her mother prays that it'll never cry ENDTOKEN
But nothing's wrong, you've got your prom dress on ENDTOKEN
When they ask you'll say "It isn't mine" ENDTOKEN
Damn you for thinking we would never know ENDTOKEN
And damn you for thinking we would never mind ENDTOKEN
Only reason that you made it this far ENDTOKEN
You never asked him, but you never tried ENDTOKEN
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away? ENDTOKEN

Look at this photograph ENDTOKEN
Every time I do, it makes me laugh ENDTOKEN
How did our eyes get so red? ENDTOKEN
And what the hell is on Joey's head? ENDTOKEN
And this is where I grew up ENDTOKEN
I think the present owner fixed it up ENDTOKEN
I never knew we ever went without ENDTOKEN
The second floor is hard for sneaking out ENDTOKEN
And this is where I went to school ENDTOKEN
Most of the time had better things to do ENDTOKEN
Criminal record says I broke in twice ENDTOKEN
I must've done it half a dozen times ENDTOKEN
I wonder if it's too late ENDTOKEN
Should I go back and try to graduate? ENDTOKEN
Life's better now than it was back then ENDTOKEN
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in ENDTOKEN
Oh, oh, oh ENDTOKEN
Oh, God, I, I ENDTOKEN
Every memory of looking out the back door ENDTOKEN
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor ENDTOKEN
It's hard to say it, time to say it ENDTOKEN
Goodbye, goodbye ENDTOKEN
Every memory of walking out the front door ENDTOKEN
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for ENDTOKEN
It's hard to say it, time to say it ENDTOKEN
Goodbye, goodbye ENDTOKEN
(Goodbye) ENDTOKEN
Remember the old arcade? ENDTOKEN
Blew every dollar that we ever made ENDTOKEN
The cops hated us hangin' out ENDTOKEN
They say somebody went and burned it down ENDTOKEN
We used to listen to the radio ENDTOKEN
And sing along with every song we know ENDTOKEN
We said someday we'd find out how it feels ENDTOKEN
To sing to more than just the steering wheel ENDTOKEN
Kim's the first girl I kissed ENDTOKEN
I was so nervous that I nearly missed ENDTOKEN
She's had a couple of kids since then ENDTOKEN
I haven't seen her since God knows when ENDTOKEN
Oh, oh, oh ENDTOKEN
Oh, God, I, I ENDTOKEN
Every memory of looking out the back door ENDTOKEN
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor ENDTOKEN
It's hard to say it, time to say it ENDTOKEN
Goodbye, goodbye ENDTOKEN
Every memory of walking out the front door ENDTOKEN
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for ENDTOKEN
It's hard to say it, time to say it ENDTOKEN
Goodbye, goodbye ENDTOKEN
I miss that town ENDTOKEN
I miss their faces ENDTOKEN
You can't erase ENDTOKEN
You can't replace it ENDTOKEN
I miss it now ENDTOKEN
I can't believe it ENDTOKEN
So hard to stay ENDTOKEN
Too hard to leave it ENDTOKEN
If I could, I'd relive those days ENDTOKEN
I know the one thing that would never change ENDTOKEN
Every memory of looking out the back door ENDTOKEN
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor ENDTOKEN
It's hard to say it, time to say it ENDTOKEN
Goodbye, goodbye ENDTOKEN
Every memory of walking out the front door ENDTOKEN
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for ENDTOKEN
It's hard to say it, time to say it ENDTOKEN
Goodbye, goodbye ENDTOKEN

Every time I do, it makes me laugh ENDTOKEN
Every time I do, it makes me ENDTOKEN
One step, two step, electric slide ENDTOKEN
Red fish, blue fish, blow your mind ENDTOKEN
Engine, engine, number nine ENDTOKEN
Mamaâ€™s gonna let you set the moon on fire ENDTOKEN
Jack be nimble, jack be quick ENDTOKEN
Jack wound up with a broken neck ENDTOKEN
Humpty Dumpty, do your thing ENDTOKEN
Daddyâ€™s gonna buy you a diamond ring ENDTOKEN
Oh, it must be nice ENDTOKEN
To spend each day in paradise ENDTOKEN
You wonder why youâ€™ve never failed ENDTOKEN
Your lifeâ€™s a goddamn fairy tale ENDTOKEN
Your lifeâ€™s a goddamn fairy tale ENDTOKEN
Suzie steamboat, youâ€™re so fine ENDTOKEN
Grant the wish I wish tonight ENDTOKEN
Tinker tailor, whatcha' got? ENDTOKEN
Wheels on the bus are falling off ENDTOKEN
Pretty maids all in a row ENDTOKEN
Yes, sir, yes, sir three bags full ENDTOKEN
Silver spoon at supper time ENDTOKEN
Four and twenty blackbirds, oh, so high ENDTOKEN
Oh, it must be nice ENDTOKEN
To spend each day in paradise ENDTOKEN
You wonder why youâ€™ve never failed ENDTOKEN
Your lifeâ€™s a goddamn fairy tale ENDTOKEN
Your lifeâ€™s a goddamn fairy tale ENDTOKEN
One step, two step, electric slide ENDTOKEN
Red fish, blue fish, blow your mind ENDTOKEN
Engine, engine, number nine ENDTOKEN
Stick your diamond ring where the sun donâ€™t shine ENDTOKEN
Oh, it must be nice ENDTOKEN
To spend each day in paradise ENDTOKEN
You wonder why youâ€™ve never failed ENDTOKEN
Your lifeâ€™s a goddamn fairy tale ENDTOKEN
Oh, it must be nice ENDTOKEN
To spend each day in paradise ENDTOKEN
You wonder why youâ€™ve never failed ENDTOKEN
Your lifeâ€™s a fucking fairy tale ENDTOKEN
My hopes just fell, and I can't see ENDTOKEN
The reason why, why there is blood on my sleeve ENDTOKEN
And all this time, I thought it mine ENDTOKEN
But it's not, it's yours and ENDTOKEN
It's not worth it for me, gets harder every time call you ENDTOKEN
This life you lead, like us living in a shiny ballroom ENDTOKEN
Next time you bleed, right about this time tomorrow ENDTOKEN
Next time you steal, better ask before you borrow ENDTOKEN
And I don't see too well, don't sing too well ENDTOKEN
And so I settle to scream ENDTOKEN
Just grab your shit, and leave with it ENDTOKEN
They won't make no statues of you ENDTOKEN
It's not worth it for me, gets harder every time call you ENDTOKEN
This life you lead, like us living in a shiny ballroom ENDTOKEN
Next time you bleed, right about this time tomorrow ENDTOKEN
Next time you steal, better ask before you borrow ENDTOKEN
This label thief, find a better title suited for you ENDTOKEN
This tidal wave, is coming down upon you ENDTOKEN
This time I've forgotten ENDTOKEN
I swear this shit was rotten ENDTOKEN
This time, I believe it ENDTOKEN
'Cause I've seen the shit you're needing ENDTOKEN
It's not worth it for me, gets harder every time call you ENDTOKEN
This life you lead, like us living in a shiny ballroom ENDTOKEN
Next time you bleed, right about this time tomorrow ENDTOKEN
Next time you steal, better ask before you borrow ENDTOKEN
This label "thief", find a better title suited for you ENDTOKEN
This tidal wave, is coming down upon you ENDTOKEN
And if forever never comes then I ENDTOKEN
And if forever never comes then I ENDTOKEN
And if forever never comes then I ENDTOKEN
Iâ€™ll hold on and hold on ENDTOKEN
I keep listening to my chest ENDTOKEN
For a beat, but thereâ€™s nothing left ENDTOKEN
Itâ€™s been a week since Iâ€™ve seen you ENDTOKEN
And I still canâ€™t believe it ENDTOKEN
'Cause Iâ€™m dying inside alone ENDTOKEN
And every day we got to be apart ENDTOKEN
Iâ€™m like a baby with a broken heart ENDTOKEN
But the second that I'll see you ENDTOKEN
You will know how much I need you ENDTOKEN
Because Iâ€™ll never be letting you go ENDTOKEN
(Well, you know I) ENDTOKEN
Iâ€™m lost without you ENDTOKEN
And thereâ€™s nothing I can do ENDTOKEN
Youâ€™re the one I canâ€™t go without ENDTOKEN
If I ain't holding on to you then I'll be holding out forever ENDTOKEN
Iâ€™ve got you now and ENDTOKEN
Iâ€™m not letting go of you ENDTOKEN
Never be together long enough ENDTOKEN
'Cause every moment Iâ€™m with you ENDTOKEN
Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m holding on to heaven ENDTOKEN
And if forever never comes then I ENDTOKEN
And if forever never comes then I ENDTOKEN
And if forever never comes then I ENDTOKEN
Iâ€™ll hold on, hold on ENDTOKEN
And if I could write a symphony ENDTOKEN
Then baby, you would be my melody ENDTOKEN
And you would flow like a river ENDTOKEN
Slowly going on forever ENDTOKEN
Like a feather thatâ€™s blowing away ENDTOKEN
Like everyone that needs a fairy tale ENDTOKEN
Like every motherâ€™s love that never fails ENDTOKEN
Like every game that needs a player ENDTOKEN
Every sinner needs a savior ENDTOKEN
I'm the villain you're willing to save ENDTOKEN
(Now you know why) ENDTOKEN
Iâ€™m lost without you ENDTOKEN
And thereâ€™s nothing I can do ENDTOKEN
Youâ€™re the one I canâ€™t go without ENDTOKEN
If I ain't holding on to you then I'll be holding out forever ENDTOKEN
Iâ€™ve got you now and ENDTOKEN
Iâ€™m not letting go of you ENDTOKEN
Never be together long enough ENDTOKEN
'Cause every moment Iâ€™m with you ENDTOKEN
Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m holding on to heaven ENDTOKEN
And Iâ€™m willing to wait ENDTOKEN
Just to see you another day ENDTOKEN
What Iâ€™m waiting for ENDTOKEN
Will wash this pain away ENDTOKEN
And itâ€™s never too late ENDTOKEN
(Never too late) ENDTOKEN
And if forever never comes then I ENDTOKEN
And if forever never comes then I ENDTOKEN
And if forever never comes then I ENDTOKEN
Iâ€™ll hold on and hold on ENDTOKEN
Now you know why ENDTOKEN
Iâ€™m lost without you ENDTOKEN
And thereâ€™s nothing I can do ENDTOKEN
Youâ€™re the one I canâ€™t go without ENDTOKEN
If I ain't holding on to you then I'll be holding out forever ENDTOKEN
Iâ€™ve got you now and ENDTOKEN

'Cause every moment Iâ€™m with you ENDTOKEN
Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m holding on to heaven ENDTOKEN
No, I don't guess ENDTOKEN
I don't sacrifice ENDTOKEN
And I know ENDTOKEN
I don't realize ENDTOKEN
Just how much ENDTOKEN
I can idolize...and I know and I know ENDTOKEN
And then I find it falls back on ENDTOKEN
On to me, to see, believe ENDTOKEN
And down onto you, We do, it's true ENDTOKEN
And I won't beg to stay, to leave, or to believe ENDTOKEN
A word you say, and then I guess ENDTOKEN
It all falls back on you ENDTOKEN
To find out (find out) ENDTOKEN
What's the deal ENDTOKEN
And I guess you don't ENDTOKEN
Simplify ENDTOKEN
It's just, you had to ENDTOKEN
Had to take, and I know and I know ENDTOKEN
And then I guess it all falls back on you ENDTOKEN
There's a fine line between right and wrong ENDTOKEN
And I know we knew all along ENDTOKEN
Just how much I can half belong...and I know and I know ENDTOKEN
And then I find it all falls back on ENDTOKEN
On to me, to see, believe ENDTOKEN
And down onto you, we do, it's true ENDTOKEN
And I won't beg to stay, to leave, or to believe ENDTOKEN

And then I find it all falls back on you ENDTOKEN
'Cause I'm really up on this ENDTOKEN
'Cause I'm really up on this ENDTOKEN
Time to see these people ENDTOKEN
Where the hell do I get through to you? ENDTOKEN
No, I don't guess ENDTOKEN
I don't sacrifice ENDTOKEN
And I know ENDTOKEN
I don't realize ENDTOKEN
Just how much ENDTOKEN
I can idolize...and I know and I know ENDTOKEN

On you ENDTOKEN
Hey there little darling, where'd the old man gone? ENDTOKEN
Why don't we get out of town and do it all night long? ENDTOKEN
We can lie out in the field 'til the morning light ENDTOKEN
Then me and your old man are gonna have to fight ENDTOKEN
Start the loving in the truck and wind up in the ditch ENDTOKEN
Then the old man will come a runnin' with a hickory switch ENDTOKEN
Oh, no, gotta learn this some day ENDTOKEN
Why, I, gotta learn the hard way ENDTOKEN
Buddy showed me just how fast a car can go ENDTOKEN
I'll race you for your pink slip right before this show ENDTOKEN
Put your girlfriend in the bet to make things good ENDTOKEN
'Cause she's been staring at me like no girlfriend should ENDTOKEN
Bastards sitting right there on the starting line ENDTOKEN
Stuck the sugar in your gas tank by myself last night ENDTOKEN
Oh, no, gotta learn this some day ENDTOKEN
Why, I, gotta learn the hard way ENDTOKEN
Ooh, yeah ENDTOKEN
Hey there little darling, where'd the old man gone? ENDTOKEN
Why don't we get out of town and do it all night long? ENDTOKEN

Oh, no, gotta learn this some day ENDTOKEN
Why, I, gotta learn the hard way ENDTOKEN
I'm back in my hometown ENDTOKEN
And Main Street's dying now ENDTOKEN
It's like there's nothing left of it ENDTOKEN
No more high school grounds ENDTOKEN
They tore that building down ENDTOKEN
And everything with it I miss ENDTOKEN
I call up my old friends ENDTOKEN
So lost since I've seen them ENDTOKEN
Feels like we're back there instantly to me ENDTOKEN
We'd all meet at Shawn's ENDTOKEN
The backyard fire's on ENDTOKEN
And we'd start telling tales of how life used to be ENDTOKEN
The years have come and gone ENDTOKEN
But these stories carry on ENDTOKEN
Looking back, they're better than they used to be ENDTOKEN
'Cause you should've seen the size of the guys we were fightin' ENDTOKEN
And we shouldn't be alive at the speeds we were driving ENDTOKEN
But Momma always taught us never to tell a lie ENDTOKEN
And every ten yard pass always turned into twenty ENDTOKEN
Every girl we were with never cost any money ENDTOKEN
And we drank more tequila than any man alive ENDTOKEN
And the story goes on, and gets a little better ENDTOKEN
Every time we're together ENDTOKEN
It's funny how we change ENDTOKEN
And some things stay the same ENDTOKEN
God, I miss the glory days, always ENDTOKEN
Daylight getting near ENDTOKEN
We shed a few more tears ENDTOKEN
Lord, I love the memories we've made ENDTOKEN
The years have come and gone ENDTOKEN
But the stories carry on ENDTOKEN
Looking back, they're better than they used to be ENDTOKEN
'Cause you should've seen the size of the guys we were fightin' ENDTOKEN

And the story goes on, and gets a little better ENDTOKEN
Every time we're together ENDTOKEN
I'm through, thinking of things to say to you ENDTOKEN
It's true, I've said enough and so have you ENDTOKEN
Just drive, you slam the door and so do I ENDTOKEN
Tongue tied, from all the little things ENDTOKEN
And they're the reason that I scream ENDTOKEN
I needed you ENDTOKEN
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head ENDTOKEN
Was I mean to you? ENDTOKEN
Car keys in your hand ENDTOKEN
I believe that you would leave me for dead ENDTOKEN
Your turn, you'd rather leave then live and learn ENDTOKEN
That's why, you want an end and so do I ENDTOKEN
This time, I'll leave, and leave it all behind ENDTOKEN
Tongue tied, from all the little things ENDTOKEN
And they're the reason that I scream ENDTOKEN

I believe that you would leave me for... ENDTOKEN
I don't live anymore ENDTOKEN
I don't love me this way ENDTOKEN
I don't have wings to fly ENDTOKEN
I don't have, gone away ENDTOKEN
I don't have anything ENDTOKEN
I don't need a space to breathe ENDTOKEN
I don't hide in sanctity ENDTOKEN
I don't need what you need ENDTOKEN
I don't have, have a space to ENDTOKEN
I don't claim to know just why ENDTOKEN
I don't try to pacify ENDTOKEN
I don't love me just yet ENDTOKEN
I don't care, gone away ENDTOKEN
This ones mine ENDTOKEN

(Hey, hey) ENDTOKEN
She had her eyes on the prize as the girl next door ENDTOKEN
You grow up quick when you grow up poor ENDTOKEN
It's the only way to LA that she knows ENDTOKEN
The Hollywood pose: teeth, tits, and toes ENDTOKEN
It didn't take her long to leave the boulevard ENDTOKEN
So many Five Star friends with black credit cards ENDTOKEN
She'd try anything once ENDTOKEN
'Cause anything goes ENDTOKEN
It never comes easy when you're digging for gold ENDTOKEN
(Hey, hey) ENDTOKEN
Well, she ain't no Cinderella ENDTOKEN
When she's getting undressed ENDTOKEN
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west ENDTOKEN
Far too pretty to be giving it cheap ENDTOKEN
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week ENDTOKEN
Yeah, she'd even break a promise in the promise-land ENDTOKEN
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands ENDTOKEN
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can ENDTOKEN
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands ENDTOKEN
(Hey, hey) ENDTOKEN
I doubt she'd even let the devil buy her little black book ENDTOKEN
City Hall would probably fall off if anyone got a look ENDTOKEN
Every A-List player is her favorite friend ENDTOKEN
Since they all taste the same in the back of the Benz ENDTOKEN
A congressman would call her every once in a while ENDTOKEN
Got the school girl skirt on the top of the pile ENDTOKEN
She'd done everyone once and everyone knows ENDTOKEN
You gotta get a little dirty when you're digging for gold ENDTOKEN
(Hey, hey) ENDTOKEN

She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands ENDTOKEN
Well, someone spilled the beans and now her name's in the press ENDTOKEN
Tough to keep it all a secret when you're one of the best ENDTOKEN
The judge is going easy 'cause he paid for her chest ENDTOKEN
Yeah, he loves his little naughty wicked witch of the west ENDTOKEN
Far too pretty to be giving it cheap ENDTOKEN
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week ENDTOKEN
Yeah, she'd even break a promise in the promise-land ENDTOKEN

I like your pants around your feet ENDTOKEN
And I like the dirt that's on your knees ENDTOKEN
And I like the way you still say please ENDTOKEN
While you're looking up at me ENDTOKEN
You're like my favourite damn disease ENDTOKEN
And I love the places that we go ENDTOKEN
And I love the people that you know ENDTOKEN
And I love the way you can't say no ENDTOKEN
