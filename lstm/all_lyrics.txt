You always reached out to me ENDTOKEN
And helped me believe ENDTOKEN
All those memories we share ENDTOKEN
I will cherish every one of them ENDTOKEN
For the truth of it is there's a right way to live ENDTOKEN
And you showed me ENDTOKEN
So now you live on in the words of a song ENDTOKEN
You're a melody ENDTOKEN
Because you stand here with me now, yeah[x2] ENDTOKEN
Just when the fear blinded me ENDTOKEN
You taught me to dream ENDTOKEN
I'll give you everything I am and still fall short of ENDTOKEN
What you've done for me ENDTOKEN
In this life that I live ENDTOKEN
I hope, I can give love unselfishly ENDTOKEN
I've learned the world is bigger than me ENDTOKEN
You're my daily dose of reality ENDTOKEN
On and on we sing, we sing this song ENDTOKEN
Because you stand here with me ENDTOKEN
On and on we sing ENDTOKEN
She wears a coat of color ENDTOKEN
Loved by some, feared by others ENDTOKEN
She's immortalized in young men's eyes ENDTOKEN
Lust she breeds in the eyes of brothers ENDTOKEN
Violent sons make bitter mothers ENDTOKEN
So close your eyes, here's your surprise ENDTOKEN
Beautiful is empty ENDTOKEN
Beautiful is free ENDTOKEN
Beautiful loves no one ENDTOKEN
Beautiful stripped me ENDTOKEN
Stripped me, stripped me ENDTOKEN
She stripped me ENDTOKEN
In your mind she's your companion ENDTOKEN
Vile instincts often candid ENDTOKEN
Your regret, is all that's left ENDTOKEN
Beautiful is empty ENDTOKEN
Beautiful is free ENDTOKEN
Beautiful loves no one ENDTOKEN
Beautiful stripped me ENDTOKEN
Stripped me, stripped me ENDTOKEN
She stripped me ENDTOKEN
She told me where I'm going ENDTOKEN
And it's far away from home ENDTOKEN
I think I'll go there on my own ENDTOKEN
She told me where I'm going ENDTOKEN
And it's far away from home ENDTOKEN
I think I'll go there on my own ENDTOKEN
Beautiful is empty ENDTOKEN
Beautiful is free ENDTOKEN
Beautiful loves no one ENDTOKEN
Beautiful stripped me ENDTOKEN
Stripped me, stripped me ENDTOKEN
She stripped me ENDTOKEN
She stripped me ENDTOKEN
Well, that straw just broke ENDTOKEN
I'm a line in your tasteless joke ENDTOKEN
What's up with that heart you've stolen? ENDTOKEN
Don't worry, 'cause it's not broken, it's just swollen ENDTOKEN
Could anticipate ENDTOKEN
How you're feeling from day to day ENDTOKEN
Well, about you now, that's your needing ENDTOKEN
Don't worry, 'cause they're laughing and you're bleeding ENDTOKEN
Well, I'm drowning in your ocean ENDTOKEN
It's much cooler in slow motion ENDTOKEN
Don't care where you've went ENDTOKEN
And not really on what you've spent ENDTOKEN
When it's obvious that you bore me ENDTOKEN
I'm not worried, 'cause it's five minutes to your glory ENDTOKEN
Well, I'm drowning in your ocean ENDTOKEN
It's much cooler in slow motion ENDTOKEN
Leave it up to me and I will ENDTOKEN
Be the one here to see that you stand still ENDTOKEN
Everyone sees your eyes getting wider ENDTOKEN
Everyone here believes you're a liar ENDTOKEN
You're a liar! ENDTOKEN
Well, that straw just broke ENDTOKEN
I'm a line in your tasteless joke ENDTOKEN
Right after you've a punched a hole in ENDTOKEN
Don't worry, 'cause it's not broken, it's just swollen ENDTOKEN
Could anticipate ENDTOKEN
How you're feeling from day to day ENDTOKEN
Since it's obvious that you bore me ENDTOKEN
I'm not worried, 'cause it's five minutes to your glory ENDTOKEN
Leave it up to me and I will ENDTOKEN
Be the one here to see that you stand still ENDTOKEN
Everyone sees your eyes getting wider ENDTOKEN
Everyone here believes you're a liar ENDTOKEN
You're a liar! ENDTOKEN
It's getting late, I haven't seen my date ENDTOKEN
So tell me when the boys get here ENDTOKEN
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock ENDTOKEN
Wanna get a belly full of beer ENDTOKEN
My old man's drunker than a bar full of winos ENDTOKEN
And my old lady, she don't care ENDTOKEN
My sister lookin' cute in her braces and boots ENDTOKEN
A handful of grease in her hair ENDTOKEN
Don't give us none of your aggravation ENDTOKEN
We had it with your discipline ENDTOKEN
Saturday night's alright for fighting ENDTOKEN
Get a little action in ENDTOKEN
Get about as oiled as a diesel train ENDTOKEN
Gonna set this town alight ENDTOKEN
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like ENDTOKEN
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright ENDTOKEN
Packed pretty tight in here tonight ENDTOKEN
I'm looking for a woman to see me right ENDTOKEN
I could use a little muscle to get what I need ENDTOKEN
I'll drink a fifth of Jack and scream out "She's with me" ENDTOKEN
A couple of sounds that I really like ENDTOKEN
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike ENDTOKEN
I'm a juvenile product of the working class ENDTOKEN
Whose best friend floats from the bottom of a glass ENDTOKEN
Don't give us none of your aggravation ENDTOKEN
We had it with your discipline ENDTOKEN
Saturday night's alright for fighting ENDTOKEN
Get a little action in ENDTOKEN
Get about as oiled as a diesel train ENDTOKEN
Gonna set this town alight ENDTOKEN

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday ENDTOKEN
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday ENDTOKEN
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's all right ENDTOKEN
Please come now I think I'm falling ENDTOKEN
I'm holding on to all I think is safe ENDTOKEN
It seems I found the road to nowhere ENDTOKEN
And I'm trying to escape ENDTOKEN
I yelled back when I heard thunder ENDTOKEN
But I'm down to one last breath ENDTOKEN
And with it let me say ENDTOKEN
Let me say ENDTOKEN
Hold me now ENDTOKEN
I'm six feet from the edge ENDTOKEN
And I'm thinking maybe six feet ENDTOKEN
Ain't so far down ENDTOKEN
I'm looking down now that it's over ENDTOKEN
Reflecting on all of my mistakes ENDTOKEN
I thought I found the road to somewhere ENDTOKEN
Somewhere in His grace ENDTOKEN
I cried out, "Heaven save me" ENDTOKEN
But I'm down to one last breath ENDTOKEN
And with it let me say ENDTOKEN
Let me say ENDTOKEN
Hold me now ENDTOKEN
I'm six feet from the edge ENDTOKEN
And I'm thinking maybe six feet ENDTOKEN
Ain't so far down ENDTOKEN
Hold me now ENDTOKEN
I'm six feet from the edge ENDTOKEN
And I'm thinking maybe six feet ENDTOKEN
Ain't so far down ENDTOKEN
I'm so far down ENDTOKEN
Sad eyes follow me ENDTOKEN
But I still believe there's ENDTOKEN
Something left for me ENDTOKEN
So please come stay with me ENDTOKEN
'Cause I still believe there's ENDTOKEN
Something left for you and me ENDTOKEN
For you and me ENDTOKEN
For you and me ENDTOKEN
Hold me now ENDTOKEN
I'm six feet from the edge ENDTOKEN
And I'm thinking ENDTOKEN
Hold me now ENDTOKEN
I'm six feet from the edge ENDTOKEN
And I'm thinking maybe six feet ENDTOKEN
Ain't so far down ENDTOKEN
Hold me now ENDTOKEN
I'm six feet from the edge ENDTOKEN
And I'm thinking maybe six feet ENDTOKEN
Ain't so far down ENDTOKEN
Please come now I think I'm falling ENDTOKEN
I'm holding on to all I think is safe ENDTOKEN
I think I've walked too close to love ENDTOKEN
And now iIm falling in ENDTOKEN
There's so many things this weary soul can't take ENDTOKEN
Maybe you just caught me by surprise ENDTOKEN
The first time that I looked into your eyes ENDTOKEN
There's a life inside of me that I can feel again ENDTOKEN
It's the only thing that takes me where I've never been ENDTOKEN
I don't care if I lost everything that I have known ENDTOKEN
It don't matter where I lay my head tonight ENDTOKEN
Your arms feel like home ENDTOKEN
Feel like home ENDTOKEN
This life ain't the fairytale we both thought it would be ENDTOKEN
But I can see your smiling face as it's staring back at me ENDTOKEN
I know we both see these changes now ENDTOKEN
I know we both understand somehow ENDTOKEN
There's a life inside of me that I can feel again ENDTOKEN
It's the only thing that takes me where I've never been ENDTOKEN
I don't care if I lost everything that I have known ENDTOKEN
It don't matter where I lay my head tonight ENDTOKEN
Your arms feel like home ENDTOKEN
Feel like home ENDTOKEN
There's a life inside of me that I can feel again ENDTOKEN
It's the only thing that takes me where I've never been ENDTOKEN
I don't care if I lost everything that I have known ENDTOKEN
It don't matter where I lay my head tonight ENDTOKEN
Your arms feel like home ENDTOKEN
Feel like home ENDTOKEN
I reside in 209, you're in 208 ENDTOKEN
You moved in last Friday night ENDTOKEN
And I just couldn't wait ENDTOKEN
So I tried to call across the hall ENDTOKEN
To ask you out someday ENDTOKEN
But a lineup formed outside your door, and I was way too late ENDTOKEN
Well, I'd rather start off slow ENDTOKEN
This whole thing's like some sort of race ENDTOKEN
Instead of winning what I want, I'm sitting here in second place ENDTOKEN
Because somewhere, the one I wanna be with's with somebody else ENDTOKEN
Oh God, I wanna be that someone that you're with ENDTOKEN
(I wanna be that someone that you're with) ENDTOKEN
And I can talk about it all day long 'till I run out of breath ENDTOKEN
But I still wanna be that someone that you're with ENDTOKEN
(I've got to be that someone that you're with) ENDTOKEN
And I'm pacing by the phone ENDTOKEN
'Cause I hate to be alone ENDTOKEN
And if you're out there with him somewhere and just about to kiss ENDTOKEN
God, I wanna be that someone that you're with ENDTOKEN
Well, I hear your favorite songs you sing along with everyday ENDTOKEN
And I borrow things that I don't need for conversation sake ENDTOKEN
Last night I heard your key, it hit your lock at 4 AM ENDTOKEN
Instead of being out with me, you must be out with them ENDTOKEN
Well, I'd rather start off slow ENDTOKEN
This whole thing's like some sort of race ENDTOKEN
Instead of winning what I want, I'm sitting here in second place ENDTOKEN
Because somewhere, the one I wanna be with's with somebody else ENDTOKEN
Oh God, I wanna be that someone that you're with ENDTOKEN
(I wanna be that someone that you're with) ENDTOKEN
And I can talk about it all day long 'till I run out of breath ENDTOKEN
But I still wanna be that someone that you're with ENDTOKEN
(I've got to be that someone that you're with) ENDTOKEN
And I'm pacing by the phone ENDTOKEN
'Cause I hate to be alone ENDTOKEN
And if you're out there with him somewhere and just about to kiss ENDTOKEN
God, I wanna be that someone that you're with ENDTOKEN
Because somewhere, the one I wanna be with's with somebody else ENDTOKEN
Oh God, I wanna be that someone that you're with ENDTOKEN
And I can talk about it all day long 'till I run out of breath ENDTOKEN
But I still wanna be that someone that you're with ENDTOKEN
(I've got to be that someone that you're with) ENDTOKEN
And I'm pacing by the phone ENDTOKEN
'Cause I hate to be alone ENDTOKEN
And if you're out there with him somewhere and just about to kiss ENDTOKEN
But God, I got to be that someone that... ENDTOKEN
I wanna be that someone that... ENDTOKEN
I've got to be that someone that you're with ENDTOKEN
I wanna do it 'til the sun comes up ENDTOKEN
'Til we're both so good and sweaty we can't stand up ENDTOKEN
I wanna do it till we're both about to drop ENDTOKEN
As long as we're caught in together then we're never gonna stop ENDTOKEN
I wanna go until the neighbors all complain ENDTOKEN
'Cause they heard somebody screaming and they think we're both in pain ENDTOKEN
I wanna go so long your parents think you died ENDTOKEN
They’re gonna call the cops, the CIA, and then the FBI ENDTOKEN
Yeah, we're gonna love it when the lights go down ENDTOKEN
(Hold on, here we go) ENDTOKEN
Yeah, we're gonna go until our legs give out ENDTOKEN
('Round and 'round we go) ENDTOKEN
Yeah, we're gonna do it hanging upside down ENDTOKEN
(Up and down we go) ENDTOKEN
Yeah, we're getting ready for the next go 'round ENDTOKEN
'Round and 'round we go ENDTOKEN
Shut the windows, lock the doors, unplug the phone ENDTOKEN
For all intents and purposes, there ain't nobody home ENDTOKEN
Then we can do it till the batteries are gone ENDTOKEN
And borrow two from the TV remote to throw this thing back on ENDTOKEN
I wanna cover you with jello in the tub ENDTOKEN
We can roll around for hours without ever coming up ENDTOKEN
I want you naked with your favorite heels on ENDTOKEN
Slap John Deere across my ass and ride me up and down the lawn ENDTOKEN
Yeah, we're gonna love it when the lights go down ENDTOKEN
(Hold on, here we go) ENDTOKEN
Yeah, we're gonna go until our legs give out ENDTOKEN
('Round and 'round we go) ENDTOKEN
Yeah, we're gonna do it hanging upside down ENDTOKEN
(Up and down we go) ENDTOKEN
Yeah, we're getting ready for the next go 'round ENDTOKEN
'Round and 'round we go ENDTOKEN
Yeah, we're gonna love it when the lights go down ENDTOKEN
(Hold on, here we go) ENDTOKEN
Yeah, we're gonna go until our legs give out ENDTOKEN
('Round and 'round we go) ENDTOKEN
Yeah, we're gonna do it hanging upside down ENDTOKEN
(Up and down we go) ENDTOKEN
Yeah, we're getting ready for the next go 'round ENDTOKEN
'Round and 'round we go ENDTOKEN
There's so much that I would say if I could see you one last time ENDTOKEN
But now I can't 'cause you're not here but you're always on my mind ENDTOKEN
When I look up and you're not there, when I lie awake at night ENDTOKEN
All these things I ask myself and I don't know why ENDTOKEN
(When it's the first time) ENDTOKEN
When is the first time that you'll never see someone again? ENDTOKEN
(When it's the last time) ENDTOKEN
When it's the last time you weren't ready for it to end? ENDTOKEN
When will I leave you standing alone there in the dark? ENDTOKEN
(It's never easy) ENDTOKEN
They're never easy but sometimes, goodbyes are so hard, they're so hard ENDTOKEN
When it's the first time that you'll never see someone again? ENDTOKEN
When it's the last time you weren't ready for it to end? ENDTOKEN
When will I leave you standing alone there in the dark? ENDTOKEN
They're never easy but sometimes goodbyes are so hard, they're so hard ENDTOKEN
I look ahead but can't move on, I look back but I can't stay ENDTOKEN
And I keep tryin to be strong, but this pain, it won't go away ENDTOKEN
And I hope this will heal in time 'cause I can't go on like this ENDTOKEN
And right now I would give my life for one last kiss ENDTOKEN
You'll be there on my mind, standing in the sunshine ENDTOKEN
It's hard to breathe, from underneath ENDTOKEN
Smothering in all your heat ENDTOKEN
It's hard to take, It's tough to break ENDTOKEN
So I don't make the same mistakes ENDTOKEN
The same mistake, the same mistake, the same mistake, the same mistake ENDTOKEN
Out in the yard is where I play ENDTOKEN
Don't come in cause I'm afraid ENDTOKEN
You saw my face, I faced my friends ENDTOKEN
Do I tell or just pretend? ENDTOKEN
I found a friend, a friend who knows ENDTOKEN
Who says He'll help but then he goes ENDTOKEN
And then he goes, and then he goes, and then he goes, and then he goes ENDTOKEN
In front of me, In front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah ENDTOKEN
I'm in the way, The way it goes, so go away, yeah, yeah ENDTOKEN
In front of me, In front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh ENDTOKEN
Fingernails, filled with dirt ENDTOKEN
If you don't tell you don't get hurt ENDTOKEN
I cry for help, I pray to God ENDTOKEN
Another tear he tries to rob ENDTOKEN
To rob me of, My dignity ENDTOKEN
Cause sanctuary's far from me ENDTOKEN
Far from me, far from me, far from me, far from me ENDTOKEN
In front of me, In front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah ENDTOKEN
I'm in the way, the way it goes, so go away, yeah, yeah ENDTOKEN
It's hard to take, A piece of me, so peacefully, yeah, yeah ENDTOKEN
In front of me, In front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah ENDTOKEN
So broke inside, Don't run away ENDTOKEN
And find another place to say ENDTOKEN
And make our inhibition go away ENDTOKEN
Because I'm so afraid, yeah, yeah ENDTOKEN
It's hard to breathe from underneath ENDTOKEN
Somethering in all your heat ENDTOKEN
It's hard to take, it's tough to break ENDTOKEN
So I don't make the same mistakes ENDTOKEN
In front of me, In front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah ENDTOKEN
I'm in the way, The way it goes, so go away, yeah, yeah ENDTOKEN
It's hard to take, a piece of me so peacefully, yeah, yeah ENDTOKEN
In front of me, in front of me, So far from me, yeah, yeah ENDTOKEN
Hush my love now don't you cry ENDTOKEN
Everything will be all right ENDTOKEN
Close your eyes and drift in dream ENDTOKEN
Rest in peaceful sleep ENDTOKEN
If there's one thing I hope I showed you[x2] ENDTOKEN
Hope I showed you ENDTOKEN
Just give love to all[x3] ENDTOKEN
Oh my love in my arms tight ENDTOKEN
Every day you give me life ENDTOKEN
As I drift off to your world ENDTOKEN
Rest in peaceful sleep ENDTOKEN
I know there's one thing that you showed me[x2] ENDTOKEN
That you showed me ENDTOKEN
They usually come around about ten o'clock ENDTOKEN
You can hear them, you can tell them by the way they knock ENDTOKEN
Somebody said the other one had a badge ENDTOKEN
Who told you, who told you? ENDTOKEN
How about if I stay and you run away? ENDTOKEN
Well, come on back and try to get some today ENDTOKEN
Well, somebody's gonna do it again ENDTOKEN
Gonna make me turn against all of my friends ENDTOKEN
So you better have something damn worthy to say ENDTOKEN
They're growing dope everywhere around the block ENDTOKEN
You can smell it, you can tell by the way they talk ENDTOKEN
Somebody stole five for gasoline ENDTOKEN
Who told you, who told you ENDTOKEN
How about if I stay and you run away? ENDTOKEN
Well, come on back and try to get some today ENDTOKEN
Well, somebody's gonna do it again ENDTOKEN
Gonna make me turn against all of my friends ENDTOKEN
So you better have something damn worthy to say ENDTOKEN
I'll never do it again (No, I won’t) ENDTOKEN
Let’s settle it (We don’t) ENDTOKEN
I can't afford my life because I'm spending it ENDTOKEN
Since you got just what you wanted ENDTOKEN
We never do anything anymore ENDTOKEN
One on the telephone, one on the door ENDTOKEN
Somebody said revenge was served sweeter cold ENDTOKEN
I told you, I told you ENDTOKEN
They're growing dope everywhere around the block ENDTOKEN
You can smell it, you can tell it by the way they talk ENDTOKEN
Somebody stole five for gasoline ENDTOKEN
Who told you, who told you? ENDTOKEN
How about if I stay and you run away? ENDTOKEN

Praise myself (I don't) ENDTOKEN
I can't afford my life because I'm spending it ENDTOKEN
Since you got just what you wanted ENDTOKEN
What you wanted ENDTOKEN
What you wanted ENDTOKEN
What you wanted ENDTOKEN
Save me now ENDTOKEN
Fallin' to pieces ENDTOKEN
Losin' control ENDTOKEN
Losin' achievements ENDTOKEN
This world chooses others than me ENDTOKEN
Forget this world ENDTOKEN
It's worst than me ENDTOKEN
(Chorus) ENDTOKEN
It's all here and I've got it together ENDTOKEN
I'm losing it all and I'm throwin' away again ENDTOKEN
I can't seem just to see tomorrow ENDTOKEN
But I can see that it's wasted me ENDTOKEN
Fallin' down ENDTOKEN
Breakin' to bleed this blazin' machine ENDTOKEN
I can't repeat this killin' my soul someone can feed me ENDTOKEN
All of this mess [shit] has wasted me ENDTOKEN
(Chorus) ENDTOKEN
It's all here and I've got it together ENDTOKEN
I'm losing it all and I'm throwin' away again ENDTOKEN
I can't seem just to see tomorrow ENDTOKEN
But I can see that it's wasted me ENDTOKEN
Well, I wanted you ENDTOKEN
I wanted no one else ENDTOKEN
I thought it through ENDTOKEN
I got you to myself ENDTOKEN
You got off ENDTOKEN
Every time you got on to me ENDTOKEN
I got caught up ENDTOKEN
In favorable slavery ENDTOKEN
Was it wrong? Was it wrong? ENDTOKEN
I guess it wasn't really right ENDTOKEN
I guess it wasn't meant to be ENDTOKEN
It didn't matter what they said ENDTOKEN
'Cause we were good in bed ENDTOKEN
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight ENDTOKEN
For all the wrong reasons ENDTOKEN
No, it didn't matter what I tried ENDTOKEN
It's just a little hard to leave ENDTOKEN
When you're going down on me ENDTOKEN
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight ENDTOKEN
For all the wrong reasons ENDTOKEN
Well, you know my friends ENDTOKEN
They know your enemies ENDTOKEN
I'd pretend ENDTOKEN
Not to hear what they said to me ENDTOKEN
'Cause I got off ENDTOKEN
Every time you got on to me ENDTOKEN
Was it wrong to go along with insanity? ENDTOKEN
Was it wrong? Was it wrong? ENDTOKEN
I guess it wasn't really right ENDTOKEN
I guess it wasn't meant to be ENDTOKEN
It didn't matter what they said ENDTOKEN
'Cause we were good in bed ENDTOKEN
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight ENDTOKEN
For all the wrong reasons ENDTOKEN
No, it didn't matter what I tried ENDTOKEN
It's just a little hard to leave ENDTOKEN
When you're going down on me ENDTOKEN
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight ENDTOKEN
For all the wrong reasons ENDTOKEN
You know I’m the best ENDTOKEN
When I stick it on your chest ENDTOKEN
I know you don't care ENDTOKEN
I can stick it anywhere ENDTOKEN
On the bus, it's the best ENDTOKEN
When I blow it on your chest ENDTOKEN
I know you don't care ENDTOKEN
I can shove it anywhere ENDTOKEN
I guess it wasn't what I wanted ENDTOKEN
Wasn't really what I thought ENDTOKEN
Thought it was the day I got ENDTOKEN
I want it all to go away ENDTOKEN
I guess it wasn't what I wanted ENDTOKEN

When you're going down on me ENDTOKEN
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight ENDTOKEN
For all the wrong reasons ENDTOKEN
I'm not supposed to be scared of anything ENDTOKEN
But I don't know where I am ENDTOKEN
I wish that I could move ENDTOKEN
But I'm exhausted and nobody understands how I feel ENDTOKEN
I'm trying hard to breathe now ENDTOKEN
But there's no air in my lungs ENDTOKEN
There's no one here to talk to ENDTOKEN
And the pain inside is making me numb ENDTOKEN
I try to hold this under control ENDTOKEN
They can't help me because no one knows ENDTOKEN
Now I'm going through changes, changes ENDTOKEN
God, I feel so frustrated lately ENDTOKEN
When I get suffocated, save me ENDTOKEN
Now I'm going through changes, changes ENDTOKEN
I'm feeling weak and weary ENDTOKEN
Walking through this world alone ENDTOKEN
Everything you say, every word of it ENDTOKEN
Cuts me to the bone ENDTOKEN
I've got something to say ENDTOKEN
But now I've got nowhere to turn ENDTOKEN
It feels like I've been buried underneath ENDTOKEN
All the weight of the world ENDTOKEN
I try to hold this under control ENDTOKEN
They can't help me because no one knows ENDTOKEN
Now I'm going through changes, changes ENDTOKEN
God, I feel so frustrated lately ENDTOKEN
When I get suffocated, save me ENDTOKEN
Now I'm going through changes, changes ENDTOKEN
I'm blind and shaking ENDTOKEN
Bound and breaking ENDTOKEN
I hope I make it through all these changes ENDTOKEN
Now I'm going through changes, changes ENDTOKEN
God, I feel so frustrated latelay ENDTOKEN
When I get suffocated, save me ENDTOKEN
Now I'm falling apart, now I feel it ENDTOKEN
But I'm going through changes, changes ENDTOKEN
God I feel so frustrated latelay ENDTOKEN
And I get suffocated, I hate this ENDTOKEN
But I'm going through changes, changes ENDTOKEN
Flying down the highway like a bat out of hell ENDTOKEN
My buddy Bradley's in the middle ENDTOKEN
Darcy's lookin' out the window ENDTOKEN
We just got high and hopin' no one can tell ENDTOKEN
But with the icky of the sticky ENDTOKEN
It don't matter where the wind blows ENDTOKEN
Lighter in my hand and I've got nothing to burn ENDTOKEN
Except a little turpentine inside of those five paint cans ENDTOKEN
Get grandpa's shotgun and we'll all take turns ENDTOKEN
But don't you ever say a word ENDTOKEN
Cause you know momma's gonna hate that ENDTOKEN
The dice that we've been rollin' ENDTOKEN
With our lives are better stolen ENDTOKEN
When you're walking through the fire for fun ENDTOKEN
Tidal wave in motion ENDTOKEN
You can't hide from the explosion ENDTOKEN
In three, two, one ENDTOKEN
We're smokin' dynamite ENDTOKEN
Too many fuses to light ENDTOKEN
(Got kingdom come, on the run) ENDTOKEN
Gonna steal, beg, and borrow ENDTOKEN
A thousand fahrenheit and we're about to ignite ENDTOKEN
So keep the throttle to the bottom ENDTOKEN
We may never see tomorrow ENDTOKEN
If tonight's our time to go, the one thing I know ENDTOKEN
We'll need a coin for the ferryman ENDTOKEN
Leave us a coin for the ferryman ENDTOKEN
Countin' every nickel, dime and five dollar bill ENDTOKEN
So we've been stealin' gasoline and laying low out on the backroads ENDTOKEN
The city lights are glowin' over the hill ENDTOKEN
And we can make it, but we take the chance of never coming back home ENDTOKEN
The dice that we've been rollin' ENDTOKEN
With our lives are better stolen ENDTOKEN
When you're walking through the fire for fun ENDTOKEN
Tidal wave in motion ENDTOKEN
You can't hide from the explosion ENDTOKEN
In three, two, one ENDTOKEN

We may never see tomorrow ENDTOKEN
If tonight's our time to go, the one thing I know ENDTOKEN
We'll need a coin for the ferryman ENDTOKEN
Leave us a coin for the ferryman ENDTOKEN
One for the road and one for those in heaven ENDTOKEN
One for the lord and take it from the devil ENDTOKEN
Don't even try, 'cause you know you can't hide ENDTOKEN
Better run, better run, better run ENDTOKEN
We're smokin' dynamite ENDTOKEN
Too many fuses to light ENDTOKEN
(Got kingdom come, on the run) ENDTOKEN
Gonna steal, beg, and borrow ENDTOKEN
A thousand fahrenheit and we're about to ignite ENDTOKEN

Leave us a coin for the ferryman ENDTOKEN
Said you wanted to feel beautiful ENDTOKEN
And did I ever tell you differently? ENDTOKEN
I tried to give you all that you deserved ENDTOKEN
And never mind the things you said to me ENDTOKEN
Along the way I didn't say all the things I felt inside myself ENDTOKEN
You took away all that I thought was mine ENDTOKEN
And then you gave it all to someone else ENDTOKEN
You said you only wanted love ENDTOKEN
But love wasn't enough ENDTOKEN
So soon enough you said goodbye ENDTOKEN
But goodbye only reminded me ENDTOKEN
Of all that I can see ENDTOKEN
And I can see your love was a lie ENDTOKEN
Everybody told me I was crazy ENDTOKEN
But you told me to believe your lies ENDTOKEN
Guess I was hoping that your love might save me ENDTOKEN
But I think I died a thousand times ENDTOKEN
I never knew this side of you ENDTOKEN
The side that I wish I had never seen ENDTOKEN
Soon enough I guess I would discover I had a lover that could be so mean ENDTOKEN
You said you only wanted love ENDTOKEN
But love wasn't enough ENDTOKEN
So soon enough you said goodbye ENDTOKEN
But goodbye only reminded me ENDTOKEN
Of all that I can see ENDTOKEN
And I can see your love was a lie ENDTOKEN
You said you only wanted love ENDTOKEN
But love wasn't enough ENDTOKEN
So soon enough you said goodbye ENDTOKEN

And did I ever tell you differently? ENDTOKEN
I tried to give you all that you deserved ENDTOKEN
Never mind the things you said ENDTOKEN
You said you only wanted love ENDTOKEN
But love wasn't enough ENDTOKEN
So soon enough you said goodbye ENDTOKEN
But goodbye only reminded me ENDTOKEN
Of all that I can see ENDTOKEN

Seven days underpaid, gotta give it up ENDTOKEN
Got no time for this life that I’m living up ENDTOKEN
Shackled down, kicked around, now slave to the grind ENDTOKEN
Need some time for myself ENDTOKEN
I’ll give you anything that you want me to ENDTOKEN
But I don't have the time, so I’ll get up with you ENDTOKEN
If you don't understand, man, you’ve gotta believe ENDTOKEN
There's too much of you, but there's not enough of me ENDTOKEN
There's not enough of me ENDTOKEN
Same old song, world moves on while I’m still in bed ENDTOKEN
Meet tomorrow today just to get ahead ENDTOKEN
Jump the gun on the run ENDTOKEN
I’m the only one who thinks I’m falling behind ENDTOKEN
I’ll give you anything that you want me to ENDTOKEN

There's too much of you, but there's not enough of me ENDTOKEN
There's not enough of me ENDTOKEN
So far away from knowing where I am going ENDTOKEN
I am trying hard to find out who I am ENDTOKEN
They all say that I don't know what I am doing ENDTOKEN
I say they don't hardly understand ENDTOKEN
Why can't they remember ENDTOKEN
What I'll never forget ENDTOKEN
How these dreams can come undone ENDTOKEN
When you're young ENDTOKEN
You give what you give 'cause they make you ENDTOKEN
Trapped inside a place that won't take you ENDTOKEN
And they want you to be what they make you ENDTOKEN
It's already over and done ENDTOKEN
When you're young ENDTOKEN
Everything seems perfect (everything seems perfect) ENDTOKEN
Everything's OK (everything's OK) ENDTOKEN
It will all get better now (get better now) ENDTOKEN
At least that's what they say ENDTOKEN
But I don't see it coming ENDTOKEN
You give what you give cause they make you ENDTOKEN
Trapped inside a place that won't take you ENDTOKEN
And they want you to be what they make you ENDTOKEN
It's already over and done ENDTOKEN
When you're young ENDTOKEN
Days never seem longer ENDTOKEN
They say it's better this way ENDTOKEN
I hope one day I am stronger than I feel ENDTOKEN
And I hope that it feels different than today ENDTOKEN
You give what you give cause they make you ENDTOKEN
Trapped inside a place that won't take you ENDTOKEN
And they want you to be what they make you ENDTOKEN
It's already over and done ENDTOKEN
It's already over and done ENDTOKEN
It's already over and done ENDTOKEN
When you're young ENDTOKEN

What I'll never forget ENDTOKEN
How these dreams can come undone ENDTOKEN
When you're young ENDTOKEN
What happens to a man when ENDTOKEN
He spills his heart on a page and ENDTOKEN
He watches words flow away then ENDTOKEN
His feelings lie on the page alone ENDTOKEN
There waiting ENDTOKEN
For someone who cares to read them ENDTOKEN
To open their eyes to see them ENDTOKEN
To see if they can make his thoughts their own ENDTOKEN
To find out that maybe your life's not perfect ENDTOKEN
Maybe it's not worth what he gives away ENDTOKEN
You can see that this broken soul is bleeding ENDTOKEN
So you concede your feelings inside yourself ENDTOKEN
And wander through my heart ENDTOKEN
Letting you see through me ENDTOKEN
Now only consumes me ENDTOKEN
Forget your pain, watch me fall apart ENDTOKEN
What happens to a soul when ENDTOKEN
It's trapped inside his emotions ENDTOKEN
And all of these words he's spoken ENDTOKEN
They bind him to the life he's left behind ENDTOKEN
And every new step he takes he ENDTOKEN
Knows that he might not make it ENDTOKEN
To all of these dreams that he has yet to find ENDTOKEN
Maybe your life's not perfect ENDTOKEN
But maybe it's not worth what he gives away ENDTOKEN
You can see that this broken soul is bleeding ENDTOKEN
So you concede your feelings inside yourself ENDTOKEN
And wander through my heart ENDTOKEN
Letting you see through me ENDTOKEN
Now only consumes me ENDTOKEN
Forget your pain and watch me fall apart ENDTOKEN
As I fall apart ENDTOKEN
You can see that this broken soul is bleeding ENDTOKEN
So you concede your feelings inside yourself ENDTOKEN
And wander through my heart ENDTOKEN
Letting you see through me ENDTOKEN
Now only consumes me ENDTOKEN
Forget your pain and watch me fall apart ENDTOKEN
As I fall apart ENDTOKEN
I can't explain ENDTOKEN
Can't quite put my finger on it ENDTOKEN
The difference that makes us so different ENDTOKEN
We've said everything ENDTOKEN
Our words only betrayed us ENDTOKEN
Nothing is left nothing was left unsaid ENDTOKEN
This time I have nothing left to lose ENDTOKEN
I'm stuck the second hand won't move ENDTOKEN
Its about time that I speak my mind ENDTOKEN
Its about time, about time to find pieces of me I have lost ENDTOKEN
Without any choice I move on ENDTOKEN
Hey time, you're no friend of mine ENDTOKEN
Hey time, you're no friend of mine ENDTOKEN
You cover yourself you cover your skin ENDTOKEN
Your cover yourself like you cover your sins ENDTOKEN
Please untie my hands ENDTOKEN
I'm a sinner, I'm a man ENDTOKEN
I ask for one minute to make you understand ENDTOKEN
This time I have nothing left to lose ENDTOKEN
I'm stuck the second hand won't move ENDTOKEN
Its about time that I speak my mind ENDTOKEN
Its about time, about time to find pieces of me I have lost ENDTOKEN
Without any choice I move on ENDTOKEN
Hey time, you're no friend of mine ENDTOKEN
Hey time, you're no friend of mine ENDTOKEN
Will you be there ENDTOKEN
To catch me when I stumble when I fall ENDTOKEN
When I fall ENDTOKEN
It's so very clear ENDTOKEN
You left me when I had no one at all ENDTOKEN
No one at all ENDTOKEN
Who will be there ENDTOKEN
To catch me, to catch me when I stumble when I fall ENDTOKEN
When I fall ENDTOKEN
It's so very clear ENDTOKEN
You left me, you left me with no one at all ENDTOKEN

You're no friend of mine ENDTOKEN
Hey time, you're no friend of mine ENDTOKEN
Hey time, you're no friend of mine ENDTOKEN
The pieces of me I have lost ENDTOKEN
Without any choice I move on ENDTOKEN
Time ENDTOKEN
Time you're no friend of mine ENDTOKEN
When the days all seem to count for nothing ENDTOKEN
Is the hope that I hold onto now gonna count for something? ENDTOKEN
When the nights all feel like they're running together ENDTOKEN
That's when I keep on dreaming about things getting better forever ENDTOKEN
All the days that come and go ENDTOKEN
Across miles so far from home ENDTOKEN
All I find roads that ramble on and on and on ENDTOKEN
There's a life, there's a life that I'm missing ENDTOKEN
So much more than I can see ENDTOKEN
There's a life, there's a life that I'm chasing ENDTOKEN
That always stays one step ahead of me ENDTOKEN
Out of reach but I know that I'm getting closer ENDTOKEN
I believe that as long as I breathe that the dream's never over ENDTOKEN
Inside myself I try to find a way to keep this hope alive ENDTOKEN
I hold the line that keeps me hanging on and on and on ENDTOKEN
There's a life, there's a life ENDTOKEN
There's a life, there's a life I see ENDTOKEN
There's a life, there's a life ENDTOKEN
There's a life, there's a life for me ENDTOKEN
She walks through the city ENDTOKEN
No one recognizes her face ENDTOKEN
They don't want her pity ENDTOKEN
No one ever mentions her name ENDTOKEN
She's carried the broken ENDTOKEN
But their scars have no name in her heart ENDTOKEN
'Cause she walks in forgiveness ENDTOKEN
She'll shine like a light in the dark ENDTOKEN
She is love ENDTOKEN
She is love ENDTOKEN
She is love ENDTOKEN
She is love ENDTOKEN
She'll always remember ENDTOKEN
The days when they welcomed her here ENDTOKEN
They know if they need her ENDTOKEN
She made a promise to always be here ENDTOKEN
She is love ENDTOKEN
She is love ENDTOKEN
She is love ENDTOKEN
She is love ENDTOKEN
When they are weak she will always be strong ENDTOKEN
Though they don't know it they're never alone ENDTOKEN
No matter how many times they may leave ENDTOKEN
It's never hopeless cause she still believes ENDTOKEN
She is love ENDTOKEN
She is love ENDTOKEN
She is love ENDTOKEN
She is love ENDTOKEN
How the hell'd we wind up like this? ENDTOKEN
Why weren't we able, to see the signs that we missed ENDTOKEN
And try to turn the tables ENDTOKEN
I wish you'd unclench your fists, and unpack your suitcase ENDTOKEN
Lately there's been too much of this ENDTOKEN
But don't think it's too late ENDTOKEN
Nothing's wrong, just as long as you know that someday I will ENDTOKEN
Someday, somehow ENDTOKEN
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now ENDTOKEN
I know you're wondering when ENDTOKEN
(You're the only one who knows that) ENDTOKEN
Someday, somehow ENDTOKEN
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now ENDTOKEN
I know you're wondering when ENDTOKEN
Well I'd hope that since we're here anyway ENDTOKEN
That we could end up saying ENDTOKEN
Things we've always needed to say ENDTOKEN
So we could end up staying ENDTOKEN
Now the story's played out like this ENDTOKEN
Just like a paperback novel ENDTOKEN
Let's rewrite an ending that fits ENDTOKEN
Instead of a Hollywood horror ENDTOKEN
Nothing's wrong, just as long as you know that someday I will ENDTOKEN

I know you're wondering when ENDTOKEN
You said "I got something to say" ENDTOKEN
Then you got that look in your eye ENDTOKEN
"There is something you've got to know" ENDTOKEN
And you said it as you started to cry ENDTOKEN
"I've been down the wrong road tonight ENDTOKEN
And I swear I'll never go there again" ENDTOKEN
I've seen this face once before ENDTOKEN
And I don't think I can do this again ENDTOKEN
There's something I can't see ENDTOKEN
There's something different in the way you smile ENDTOKEN
Behind those eyes you lie ENDTOKEN
And there's nothing I can say ENDTOKEN
Cause I'm never gonna change your mind ENDTOKEN
Behind those eyes you hide ENDTOKEN
As you turned to walk away ENDTOKEN
I saw another look in your eye ENDTOKEN
And even though it hurt like it did ENDTOKEN
I couldn't let this be your goodbye ENDTOKEN
You say that you're sorry ENDTOKEN
And you say now that it hurts you the same ENDTOKEN
Is there something here to believe ENDTOKEN
Or is it just another part of the game? ENDTOKEN
There's something I can't see ENDTOKEN
There's something different in the way you smile ENDTOKEN
Behind those eyes you lie ENDTOKEN
And there's nothing I can say ENDTOKEN

Well, I've got two tickets to the game ENDTOKEN
It'd be great if I could take you to it this Sunday ENDTOKEN
And I'll walk you home when the whole thing's done ENDTOKEN
If you're there, I don't even care which team won ENDTOKEN
We can stop at the coffee shop ENDTOKEN
And make fun of the cops in the parking lot ENDTOKEN
We can laugh as we both pretend ENDTOKEN
That we're not in love and that we're just good friends ENDTOKEN
Well, I'm tired of pretending ENDTOKEN
But I'm terrified of it ending ENDTOKEN
I know if not for you, there's nothing I could do to ever let it end ENDTOKEN
And you know I feel the same way ENDTOKEN
'Cause I told you drunk on my birthday ENDTOKEN
And as you pulled to me ENDTOKEN
You whispered in my ear, "Don't ever let it end" ENDTOKEN
Don't let it end ENDTOKEN
Don't let it end ENDTOKEN
Don't ever, don't ever let it end ENDTOKEN
Saturday, I'm gonna take her out ENDTOKEN
Cause her favorite band is going to play downtown ENDTOKEN
Gonna sing the song we've all heard of ENDTOKEN
About those two young friends that should've fell in love ENDTOKEN
Later on, we'll cut through the park ENDTOKEN
And she can hold my hand, 'cause she hates the dark ENDTOKEN
And we can laugh as we both pretend ENDTOKEN
That we're not in love and that we're just good friends ENDTOKEN
Well, I'm tired of pretending ENDTOKEN
But I'm terrified of it ending ENDTOKEN
I know if not for you, there's nothing I could do to ever let it end ENDTOKEN

Don't let it end ENDTOKEN
Don't ever, don't ever let it end ENDTOKEN
The greatest times we ever had ENDTOKEN
It's crazy now just looking back, we can laugh ENDTOKEN
You never know where life's gonna go ENDTOKEN
'Cause we're the only ones who'll ever know ENDTOKEN
About Sunday night, just her and I ENDTOKEN
Sitting side by side in the full moonlight ENDTOKEN
I pulled her close, just to hold her tight ENDTOKEN
And the both of us could tell it just felt right ENDTOKEN
She looked at me in the sweetest way ENDTOKEN
Like she could tell what the hell I was about to say ENDTOKEN
Must've took a while just to find the words ENDTOKEN
'Cause she cut me off and finally said it first ENDTOKEN
Well, I'm tired of pretending ENDTOKEN

A hundred days have made me older ENDTOKEN
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face ENDTOKEN
A thousand lies have made me colder ENDTOKEN
And I don't think I can look at this the same ENDTOKEN
But all the miles that separate ENDTOKEN
Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face ENDTOKEN
I'm here without you, baby ENDTOKEN
But you're still on my lonely mind ENDTOKEN
I think about you, baby ENDTOKEN
And I dream about you all the time ENDTOKEN
I'm here without you, baby ENDTOKEN
But you're still with me in my dreams ENDTOKEN
And tonight, it's only you and me, yeah ENDTOKEN
The miles just keep rolling ENDTOKEN
As the people leave their way to say hello ENDTOKEN
I've heard this life is overrated ENDTOKEN
But I hope that it gets better as we go ENDTOKEN
Oh yeah, yeah ENDTOKEN
I'm here without you, baby ENDTOKEN

Everything I know, and anywhere I go ENDTOKEN
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love ENDTOKEN
And when the last one falls ENDTOKEN
When it's all said and done ENDTOKEN
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love ENDTOKEN
Whoa, oh, oh ENDTOKEN
I'm here without you, baby ENDTOKEN
But you're still on my lonely mind ENDTOKEN
I think about you, baby ENDTOKEN

Yeah ENDTOKEN
Oh, yeah ENDTOKEN
I saw the river, just pulled him down ENDTOKEN
I knew the man who hunted him down ENDTOKEN
We watched the river, take him away ENDTOKEN
Before he died, I could have sworn he said ENDTOKEN
Ooh, I am the only one ENDTOKEN
Ooh, I am the only one left ENDTOKEN
Ooh, I am the only one ENDTOKEN
Ooh, I am the only one ENDTOKEN
Ooh, I am the only one left ENDTOKEN
Tired and afraid lies a saddened man ENDTOKEN
Knelt beside him with head in hand ENDTOKEN
And escaped on a lonely breath ENDTOKEN
But before he died, I could have sworn he said ENDTOKEN
Ooh, I am the only one ENDTOKEN
Ooh, I am the only one left ENDTOKEN
Ooh, I am the only one ENDTOKEN
Ooh, I am the only one left ENDTOKEN
Who ever gave a damn about you ENDTOKEN

There's clothes all over the floor ENDTOKEN
I don't remember them being here before ENDTOKEN
Smell of perfume isn't here ENDTOKEN
Why's lipstick on the mirror? ENDTOKEN
And still I don't understand ENDTOKEN
No pictures left in the hall ENDTOKEN
There's three new holes in my wall ENDTOKEN
Where the hells my credit cards? Why's my wallet in the yard? ENDTOKEN
And still I don't understand ENDTOKEN
Well, now I guess I should've listened ENDTOKEN
When you said you'd had enough ENDTOKEN
A little trick I picked up from my father ENDTOKEN
In one ear and out the other, why's love gotta be so tough? ENDTOKEN
Should see the look on my face ENDTOKEN
My shit's all over the place ENDTOKEN
Why's this happening to me? Why'd you take both sets of keys? ENDTOKEN
And still I don't understand ENDTOKEN
Well, now I guess I should've listened ENDTOKEN

A little trick I picked up from my father ENDTOKEN
In one ear and out the other, why's love gotta be so tough? ENDTOKEN

When you said you'd had enough ENDTOKEN
A little trick I picked up from my father ENDTOKEN
In one ear and out the other, why's love gotta be so tough? ENDTOKEN
When dreaming I'm guided to another world ENDTOKEN
Time and time again ENDTOKEN
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep ENDTOKEN
Because I don't want to leave the comfort of this place ENDTOKEN
Because there's a hunger, a longing to escape ENDTOKEN
From the life I live when I'm awake ENDTOKEN
So let's go there ENDTOKEN
Let's make our escape ENDTOKEN
Come on, let's go there ENDTOKEN
Let's ask, "Can we stay?" ENDTOKEN
Can you take me higher? ENDTOKEN
To a place where blind men see ENDTOKEN
Can you take me higher? ENDTOKEN
To a place with golden streets ENDTOKEN
Although I would like our world to change ENDTOKEN
It helps me to appreciate ENDTOKEN
Those nights and those dreams ENDTOKEN
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights ENDTOKEN
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same ENDTOKEN
The only difference is ENDTOKEN
To let love replace all our hate ENDTOKEN
So let's go there ENDTOKEN
Let's make our escape ENDTOKEN
Come on, let's go there ENDTOKEN
Let's ask, "Can we stay?" ENDTOKEN
Can you take me higher? ENDTOKEN

So let's go there ENDTOKEN
Let's make our escape ENDTOKEN
Come on, let's go there ENDTOKEN
Let's ask, "Can we stay?" ENDTOKEN
Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time ENDTOKEN
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine ENDTOKEN

Another day in some other place ENDTOKEN
Could someone please remind me ENDTOKEN
Where the hell we are? ENDTOKEN
Another night I feel it come to life ENDTOKEN
How could this go so far? ENDTOKEN
The life I love is the one I lead ENDTOKEN
It gets crazy but that's fine by me ENDTOKEN
'Cause I don't see the day ENDTOKEN
When I run all night ENDTOKEN
But I’ve got to say there's no other way ENDTOKEN
'Cause I’m having the time of my life ENDTOKEN
The words you sing bring back memories ENDTOKEN
Of so many days that have gone ENDTOKEN
I look back and smile at those forgotten miles ENDTOKEN
And laugh at all that went wrong ENDTOKEN
What I am is what I want ENDTOKEN
And I’ll be this way 'til I’m dead and gone ENDTOKEN
'Cause I don't see the day ENDTOKEN
When I run all night ENDTOKEN
But I’ve got to say there's no other way ENDTOKEN
'Cause I’m having the time of my life ENDTOKEN
For me that's all I need ENDTOKEN
To live the way ENDTOKEN
To live the way I please ENDTOKEN
The life I love is the one I lead ENDTOKEN
It gets crazy but that's fine by me ENDTOKEN
'Cause I don't see the day ENDTOKEN
When I run all night ENDTOKEN
But I’ve got to say there's no other way ENDTOKEN
'Cause I’m having the time of my life ENDTOKEN
There's some things that I can't make right ENDTOKEN
And it's been so long lord since I’ve been home ENDTOKEN
But I’m having the time of my life ENDTOKEN
He said he's falling to pieces ENDTOKEN
Fighting the boy and the man ENDTOKEN
Over his shoulder there was freedom ENDTOKEN
But consciousness has tied his hands ENDTOKEN
Embodied youth was his distinction ENDTOKEN
Now inhibition's in demand ENDTOKEN
So driven by his fear of weakness ENDTOKEN
That's his key to understand ENDTOKEN
So far in a distant land ENDTOKEN
There's a fight between boy and man ENDTOKEN
See the light through the open door ENDTOKEN
Sit and watch as the young grow old ENDTOKEN
Trading places in the circle ENDTOKEN
Turn the glass, spill the sand ENDTOKEN
They say that time can make the difference ENDTOKEN
But age doesn't make you a man ENDTOKEN
So far in a distant land ENDTOKEN
There's a fight between boy and man ENDTOKEN
See the light through the open door ENDTOKEN
Sit and watch as the young grow old ENDTOKEN
So young but overblown ENDTOKEN
So young but overblown ENDTOKEN
So young but overblown (So young but overblown) ENDTOKEN
So young but overblown ENDTOKEN
Take a look now, see the boy is weakened ENDTOKEN
Watch him fade, watch him fade away ENDTOKEN
Take a bow and the boy is defeated ENDTOKEN
Is this the way, this the way? ENDTOKEN
So far in a distant land ENDTOKEN
There's a fight between boy and man ENDTOKEN
See the light through the open door ENDTOKEN
Sit and watch as the young grow old ENDTOKEN
To what do I owe this gift, my friend? ENDTOKEN
My life, my love, my soul? ENDTOKEN
I've been dancing with the devil ENDTOKEN
Way too long ENDTOKEN
And it's making me grow old ENDTOKEN
Making me grow old ENDTOKEN
Let's leave all this and get away ENDTOKEN
Get lost in time ENDTOKEN
Where there's no reason left to hide ENDTOKEN
Let's leave all this and get away ENDTOKEN
Run in fields of time ENDTOKEN
Where there's no reason left to hide ENDTOKEN
No reason left to hide ENDTOKEN
What you're going to do when ENDTOKEN
You're gift dear child? ENDTOKEN
Give life, give love, give soul ENDTOKEN
Divided is the one who dances ENDTOKEN
For the soul is so exposed ENDTOKEN
So exposed ENDTOKEN
There is no reason to hide[x4] ENDTOKEN

Well I say a sad goodbye ENDTOKEN
And then I move on ENDTOKEN
Well baby my heart goes blind whenever you're gone ENDTOKEN
And I know that you'll come back ENDTOKEN
And that gets me by ENDTOKEN
But holding you in my arms ENDTOKEN
Oh, well that gets me high ENDTOKEN
And I hope that this is never ending ENDTOKEN
I just wanna see how it unfolds ENDTOKEN
If you're ever gonna go, then never let it show ENDTOKEN
'Cause I don't wanna know ENDTOKEN
Just say you'll stand right here forever ENDTOKEN
Through every high and through every low ENDTOKEN
If you're ever gonna go, then never let it show ENDTOKEN

And I don't care where you hide ENDTOKEN
Or secrets you keep ENDTOKEN
Well baby if this love's a knife ENDTOKEN
Then bury it deep ENDTOKEN

Where will you be when the sky comes down? ENDTOKEN
And what would you do if the strength was found? ENDTOKEN
Stay right beside me when the ground starts shaking ENDTOKEN
The only sound you'll hear is the breath we're taking ENDTOKEN
If there is one thing I can promise you ENDTOKEN
We'll see the light again ENDTOKEN
This is the calm before the coming storm ENDTOKEN
This is the red sky morning ENDTOKEN
Without warning now ENDTOKEN
This is the fight that we've been waiting for ENDTOKEN
And there's no sense in running ENDTOKEN
The hammer's coming down (own) ENDTOKEN

It only hurts to breathe ENDTOKEN
I got lost out there in this world ENDTOKEN
Looking for a brand new way to fall down ENDTOKEN
It's no surprise that things gotten worse ENDTOKEN
And I thank God you never let me drown ENDTOKEN
But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long ENDTOKEN
I didn't have to let myself get so far gone ENDTOKEN
I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone ENDTOKEN
I didn't have to die to go to heaven ENDTOKEN
I just had to go home ENDTOKEN
While I was having the time of my life ENDTOKEN
I think my soul died a little every day ENDTOKEN
I always called to say I'm sorry ENDTOKEN
You said it's okay ENDTOKEN
But you should be through it all ENDTOKEN
You never walked away ENDTOKEN
But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long ENDTOKEN
I didn't have to let myself get so far gone ENDTOKEN
I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone ENDTOKEN
I didn't have to die to go to heaven ENDTOKEN
I just had to go home ENDTOKEN
Into the arms of my angel ENDTOKEN
Into the peace I left behind ENDTOKEN
All I had to do to save my own life ENDTOKEN
Was to look into your eyes ENDTOKEN
But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long ENDTOKEN
I didn't have to let myself get so far gone ENDTOKEN
I didn't have to make the ones I love feel so alone ENDTOKEN
I didn't have to die to go to heaven (to find my angel) ENDTOKEN
But I didn't have to lie to myself for so long ENDTOKEN
I just had to go home ENDTOKEN
I just had to go home ENDTOKEN
I just had to go home ENDTOKEN
The open wound she hides ENDTOKEN
She just keeps it bundled up ENDTOKEN
And never lets it show ENDTOKEN
She can't take much more of this ENDTOKEN
But she can't let it go ENDTOKEN
And that's ok, she don't want the world ENDTOKEN
All the things she says ENDTOKEN
While he's just lying there ENDTOKEN
Without someone to hear her cry ENDTOKEN
She slips off into a dream ENDTOKEN
About a place to hide ENDTOKEN
And that's ok, she don't want the world ENDTOKEN
This love she feels ENDTOKEN
Everything she's ever known ENDTOKEN
Or ever thought was real ENDTOKEN
Seems like it's been thrown away ENDTOKEN
Now how's she gonna live ENDTOKEN
It's ok, she don't want the world ENDTOKEN
Those words he never spoke ENDTOKEN
Haunt her life, the memories ENDTOKEN
Of all the times before ENDTOKEN
She tried to show him love ENDTOKEN
While he would only ask for more ENDTOKEN
But it's ok, she don't want the world ENDTOKEN
Softly in her sleep ENDTOKEN
Pictures of the life she's longing ENDTOKEN
For slowly appear ENDTOKEN
She's seen them all before ENDTOKEN
But somehow never quite this clear ENDTOKEN
She just smiles, she don't want the world ENDTOKEN
This love she feels ENDTOKEN
Everything she's ever known ENDTOKEN
Or ever thought was real ENDTOKEN
Seems like it's been thrown away ENDTOKEN
Now how's she gonna live ENDTOKEN
It's ok, she don't want the world ENDTOKEN
A brand new morning shines ENDTOKEN
As she wakes up alone again ENDTOKEN
This time to face the day ENDTOKEN
She swears there's time to make it ENDTOKEN
As she simply walks away ENDTOKEN
And it's ok, she don't want the world ENDTOKEN
I guess I just got lost ENDTOKEN
Being someone else ENDTOKEN
I tried to kill the pain ENDTOKEN
Nothin' ever helped ENDTOKEN
I left myself behind ENDTOKEN
Somewhere along the way ENDTOKEN
Hoping to come back around ENDTOKEN
To find myself someday ENDTOKEN
Lately, I'm so tired of waiting for you ENDTOKEN
To say that it's ok, but tell me ENDTOKEN
Please, would you one time ENDTOKEN
Just let me be myself ENDTOKEN
So I can shine with my own light ENDTOKEN
Let me be myself ENDTOKEN
Would you let me be myself ENDTOKEN
I'll never find my heart ENDTOKEN
Behind someone else ENDTOKEN
I'll never see the light of day ENDTOKEN
Living in this cell ENDTOKEN
It's time to make my way ENDTOKEN
Into the world I knew ENDTOKEN
Take back all of these times ENDTOKEN
That I gave in to you ENDTOKEN
Lately I'm so tired of waiting for you ENDTOKEN
To say that it's ok, but tell me ENDTOKEN
Please, would you one time ENDTOKEN
Just let me be myself ENDTOKEN
So I can shine with my own light ENDTOKEN
Let me be myself ENDTOKEN
For a while, if you don't mind ENDTOKEN
Let me be myself ENDTOKEN
So I can shine with my own light ENDTOKEN
Let me be myself ENDTOKEN
That's all I've ever wanted from this world ENDTOKEN
Is to let me be me ENDTOKEN
Please, would you one time ENDTOKEN
Let me be myself ENDTOKEN
So I can shine with my own light ENDTOKEN
Let me be myself ENDTOKEN
Please, would you one time ENDTOKEN
Let me be myself ENDTOKEN
So I can shine with my own light ENDTOKEN
Let me be myself ENDTOKEN
For a while, if you don't mind ENDTOKEN
Let me be myself ENDTOKEN
So I can shine with my own light ENDTOKEN
Let me be myself ENDTOKEN
Would you one time...oooh ENDTOKEN
Let me be myself ENDTOKEN
Let me be me ENDTOKEN
This world asks for so much ENDTOKEN
Despite what you give it's just never enough ENDTOKEN
Then you're left cold tired and alone ENDTOKEN
Searching for something that's already gone ENDTOKEN
You try not to be afraid ENDTOKEN
Bound down by all of these things that they say ENDTOKEN
And you feel like you're all by yourself ENDTOKEN
But I’ll be right here when there's nothing else ENDTOKEN
Lay down ENDTOKEN
Rest here in peace in my arms now ENDTOKEN
Knowing you're safe ENDTOKEN
From the storms and the rain ENDTOKEN
And from all of your pain ENDTOKEN
And I’ll be here when only the silence remains ENDTOKEN
Only the silence remains ENDTOKEN
Your fears they know that you're scared ENDTOKEN
Wherever you go they seem to meet you there ENDTOKEN
And you face them all on your own ENDTOKEN
Never the weak always the strong ENDTOKEN
And you win most of the time ENDTOKEN
Never once claiming that victory's mine ENDTOKEN
And you carry this burden alone ENDTOKEN
But this candle's burned at both ends for so long ENDTOKEN
Lay down ENDTOKEN
Rest here in peace in my arms now ENDTOKEN
Knowing you're safe ENDTOKEN
From the storms and the rain ENDTOKEN
And from all of your pain ENDTOKEN
And I’ll be here when only the silence remains ENDTOKEN
Only the silence remains ENDTOKEN
Lay down ENDTOKEN
Lay down ENDTOKEN
Lay down ENDTOKEN
Lay down ENDTOKEN
Rest here in peace in my arms now ENDTOKEN
Knowing you're safe ENDTOKEN
From the storms and the rain ENDTOKEN
And from all of your pain ENDTOKEN
And I’ll be here when only the silence remains ENDTOKEN
Only the silence remains ENDTOKEN
Lay down ENDTOKEN
Rest here in peace in my arms now ENDTOKEN
Knowing you're safe ENDTOKEN
From the storms and the rain ENDTOKEN
And from all of your pain ENDTOKEN
And I’ll be here when only the silence remains ENDTOKEN
Only the silence remains ENDTOKEN
Well I just heard the news today ENDTOKEN
It seems my life is going to change ENDTOKEN

Then tears of joy stream down my face ENDTOKEN
With arms wide open under the sunlight ENDTOKEN

And I've lost track ENDTOKEN
Of all the ones I loved and turned my back ENDTOKEN
Inside myself the words I say ENDTOKEN
It couldn't be the truth when lies got in the way ENDTOKEN
But tomorrow will be a brand new day ENDTOKEN
And I hope that it brings the chance that I forgot to take ENDTOKEN
And I know there's so much I can be ENDTOKEN
If I can be strong enough to throw away these weak pieces of me ENDTOKEN
These tired eyes and hollow skin ENDTOKEN
They remind me of the places that I've been ENDTOKEN
I feel so far, but still so close ENDTOKEN
It feels like I'm living inside my own ghost ENDTOKEN
But tomorrow will be a brand new day ENDTOKEN
And I hope that it brings the chance that I forgot to take ENDTOKEN
And I know there's so much I can be ENDTOKEN
If I can be strong enough to throw away these weak pieces of me ENDTOKEN
I've gone to sleep in heaven ENDTOKEN
Only to wake in hell ENDTOKEN

So light the match and you and I will ENDTOKEN
Fly learn to ENDTOKEN
Fly learn to ENDTOKEN

Because I'm on my hands and knees, I've crawled eternity to beg forgiveness ENDTOKEN
And someday, I'll be there I swear to you, God, as my witness ENDTOKEN
For all the trusts I've broke and, let justice know, it's just that easy ENDTOKEN
Because I'm a liar, I conspired, I'm a liar ENDTOKEN
And father tell your son ENDTOKEN
It's not your gun and bloody hands ENDTOKEN
Don't hide behind locked doors ENDTOKEN
In dresser drawers those bullets wait to fly ENDTOKEN
Fly wait to ENDTOKEN

Looking forward, not behind ENDTOKEN
Everybody's got to cross that line ENDTOKEN
Free me now to give me a place ENDTOKEN
Keep me caged and free the beast ENDTOKEN
Falling faster, time goes by ENDTOKEN
Fear is not seen through these eyes ENDTOKEN
What there was will never be ENDTOKEN
Now I'm blind and cannot see ENDTOKEN
Kiss me while I’m still alive ENDTOKEN
Kill me while I kiss the sky ENDTOKEN

Tears forget, that's more than I can do ENDTOKEN

The cradle of civilization sparks my fascination ENDTOKEN
Truth ignites our generation to change what's been programmed ENDTOKEN
Inside the mind ENDTOKEN
Don't you turn a blind eye ENDTOKEN
Change what's been programmed inside ENDTOKEN
Don't you turn a blind eye ENDTOKEN
Listen to me when I tell you ENDTOKEN
Feel the passion in my breath ENDTOKEN
Stay on top if they let you ENDTOKEN

Leave the past behind ENDTOKEN
Forget everything you know ENDTOKEN
Make a change, let go ENDTOKEN
Leave the past behind ENDTOKEN
Make a change ENDTOKEN
Let go[x5] ENDTOKEN
The sun rises to another day ENDTOKEN
My constitution keeps changing till it slips away ENDTOKEN
So I lie awake and stare ENDTOKEN
My mind thinking, just wondering does anybody care ENDTOKEN
Should I stay or go? ENDTOKEN
Should I sleep or stay awake? ENDTOKEN
Am I really happy or is it all ENDTOKEN
Just an illusion? ENDTOKEN
Sitting in my room now ENDTOKEN
Hiding thoughts, just hoping one day I'll get out ENDTOKEN
I hear a voice call my name ENDTOKEN
Breaking trance so silent, so I can stay the same ENDTOKEN
Wait now, many things are left unsaid ENDTOKEN
This life remains the same but I change ENDTOKEN
I try to fool myself in believing ENDTOKEN
Things are going to get better but life goes on ENDTOKEN
Just an illusion[x5] ENDTOKEN
One more kiss could be the best thing ENDTOKEN
But one more lie could be the worst ENDTOKEN
And all these thoughts are never resting ENDTOKEN
And you're not something I deserve ENDTOKEN
In my head, there's only you now ENDTOKEN
This world falls on me ENDTOKEN
In this world, there's real and make believe ENDTOKEN
And this seems real to me ENDTOKEN
You love me, but you don't know who I am ENDTOKEN
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand ENDTOKEN
And you love me, but you don't know who I am ENDTOKEN
So let me go ENDTOKEN
Let me go ENDTOKEN
I dream ahead to what I hope for ENDTOKEN
And I turn my back on loving you ENDTOKEN
How can this love be a good thing ENDTOKEN
When I know what I'm goin' through ENDTOKEN
In my head, there's only you now ENDTOKEN
This world falls on me ENDTOKEN
In this world, there's real and make believe ENDTOKEN
And this seems real to me ENDTOKEN
You love me, but you don't know who I am ENDTOKEN
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand ENDTOKEN
And you love me but you don't know who I am ENDTOKEN
So let me go ENDTOKEN
Just let me go ENDTOKEN
Let me go ENDTOKEN
And no matter how hard I try ENDTOKEN
I can't escape these things inside I know ENDTOKEN
I know ENDTOKEN
When all the pieces fall apart ENDTOKEN
You will be the only one who knows ENDTOKEN
Who knows ENDTOKEN
You love me, but you don't know who I am ENDTOKEN
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand ENDTOKEN
And you love me, but you don't know who I am ENDTOKEN
So let me go ENDTOKEN
Just let me go ENDTOKEN
And you love me, but you don't ENDTOKEN
You love me, but you don't ENDTOKEN
You love me, but you don't know who I am ENDTOKEN
And you love me, but you don't ENDTOKEN
You love me, but you don't ENDTOKEN
You love me, but you don't know me ENDTOKEN
I, I'm driving black on black ENDTOKEN
Just got my license back ENDTOKEN
I got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track ENDTOKEN
I'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride ENDTOKEN
'Cause the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight ENDTOKEN
I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out ENDTOKEN
I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run ENDTOKEN
Your mom don't know that you were missing ENDTOKEN
She'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you that I've been kissing ENDTOKEN
Screamin' ENDTOKEN
No, we're never gonna quit ENDTOKEN
Ain't nothing wrong with it ENDTOKEN
Just acting like we're animals (Animals) ENDTOKEN
No, no matter where we go ENDTOKEN
'Cause everybody knows ENDTOKEN
We're just a couple of animals (Animals) ENDTOKEN
So come on baby, get in ENDTOKEN
Get in, just get in ENDTOKEN
Check out the trouble we're in ENDTOKEN
You're beside me on the seat ENDTOKEN
Got your hand between my knees ENDTOKEN
And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze ENDTOKEN
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear ENDTOKEN
But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears ENDTOKEN
By now, no doubt that we were heading south ENDTOKEN
I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth ENDTOKEN
'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch ENDTOKEN
It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch ENDTOKEN
I'm screamin' ENDTOKEN
No, we're never gonna quit ENDTOKEN
Ain't nothing wrong with it ENDTOKEN
Just acting like we're animals (Animals) ENDTOKEN
No, no matter where we go ENDTOKEN
'Cause everybody knows ENDTOKEN
We're just a couple of animals (Animals) ENDTOKEN
So come on baby, get in ENDTOKEN
Get in, just get in ENDTOKEN
Look at the trouble we're in ENDTOKEN
We were parked out by the tracks ENDTOKEN
We're sitting in the back and we just started getting busy ENDTOKEN
When she whispered "What was that?" ENDTOKEN
"The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are" ENDTOKEN
And that was when she started screamin' ENDTOKEN
"That's my dad outside the car!" ENDTOKEN
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition ENDTOKEN
Must have wound up on the floor while we were switching our positions ENDTOKEN
I guess they knew that she was missing ENDTOKEN
As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing ENDTOKEN
Screamin' ENDTOKEN
No, we're never gonna quit ENDTOKEN
Ain't nothing wrong with it ENDTOKEN
Just acting like we're animals (Animals) ENDTOKEN
No, no matter where we go ENDTOKEN
'Cause everybody knows ENDTOKEN
We're just a couple of animals (Animals) ENDTOKEN
So come on baby, get in ENDTOKEN
(We're just a couple of animals) ENDTOKEN
Get in, just get in ENDTOKEN
Ain't nothing wrong with it ENDTOKEN
Check out the trouble we're in ENDTOKEN
(We're just a couple of animals) ENDTOKEN
Get in, just get in ENDTOKEN
All men with stars upon the chest ENDTOKEN
Save yourselves, your families ENDTOKEN
Don't worry about the rest ENDTOKEN
Small child receives light through the crack ENDTOKEN
The human mile, they're never coming back ENDTOKEN
Hold out your hand and ask for some ENDTOKEN
Now and again, she sits beneath the tree ENDTOKEN
The sign above reads ENDTOKEN
"Hard Work Will Set You Free" ENDTOKEN
Hold out your hand and ask for some ENDTOKEN
Hold out your hand and ask for some ENDTOKEN
Too late for another direction ENDTOKEN
Always what we've got in store ENDTOKEN

How could this affect my life? ENDTOKEN
How could I affect the outcome? ENDTOKEN
So why even try; for what, for what, for what, for what? ENDTOKEN
A coward can save the day ENDTOKEN
When the bravest of men just stand by ENDTOKEN
So easy to say; so what, so what, so what? ENDTOKEN
So what if we all stand up? ENDTOKEN
What if we don't give in? ENDTOKEN
What if we traded all complacency for a voice that won't be ignored? ENDTOKEN
How can we just give up? ENDTOKEN
How can we just give in? ENDTOKEN
What if the silent majority wasn't silent anymore? ENDTOKEN
A candle's the smallest light ENDTOKEN
But a handful becomes a lighthouse ENDTOKEN
Cutting the night for us, for us, for us, for us ENDTOKEN
The one with the loudest voice is rarely the one to follow ENDTOKEN
Silence the noise; so what, so what, so what? ENDTOKEN

Two men ENDTOKEN
They started walking ENDTOKEN
Started talking about better days ENDTOKEN
One says to the other ENDTOKEN
We do it all again ENDTOKEN
Seems I knew I would ENDTOKEN
And now I found it ENDTOKEN
Found I adored it ENDTOKEN
I didn't want this ENDTOKEN
Somebody help me see ENDTOKEN
Now I feel it ENDTOKEN
Feel like I've been there ENDTOKEN
I didn't need this ENDTOKEN
Somebody help me breathe ENDTOKEN
Here we are again ENDTOKEN
Just face to facing ENDTOKEN
Each other another day ENDTOKEN
Who wins? ENDTOKEN
Well, who cares ENDTOKEN
It always ends up the same ENDTOKEN
Seems I knew I would ENDTOKEN
And now I found it ENDTOKEN
Found I adored it ENDTOKEN
I didn't want this ENDTOKEN
Somebody help me see ENDTOKEN
And now I feel it ENDTOKEN
Feel that I've been there ENDTOKEN
I didn't need this ENDTOKEN
Would somebody help me stand? ENDTOKEN
And now I've told them ENDTOKEN
Already warned them ENDTOKEN
I didn't want this ENDTOKEN
Somebody help me breathe ENDTOKEN
If I was them ENDTOKEN
Then I wanna be ENDTOKEN
What I see ENDTOKEN
If I could drag my life in a moment ENDTOKEN
Wanna know, do you want me to go? ENDTOKEN
Going to keep it all from ending ENDTOKEN
Never stop myself from pretending ENDTOKEN
That you always knew that I never could ENDTOKEN
All I ever really wanted was to be the same ENDTOKEN
Equal treatment never ever comes ENDTOKEN
And there they go again ENDTOKEN
All I ever really wanted was to be like you ENDTOKEN
So perfect ENDTOKEN
So worthless ENDTOKEN
If I could take it all back think again ENDTOKEN
I would ENDTOKEN
And now I found it ENDTOKEN
Found I adored it ENDTOKEN

Children all have saviors ENDTOKEN
Children don't care who saves us ENDTOKEN
Round the corner, round the bend ENDTOKEN
Fingernails torn to the end ENDTOKEN
Bring back, bring back ENDTOKEN
Bring back, bring back on me ENDTOKEN
On me ENDTOKEN
I told them, we scold them ENDTOKEN
Can't console them always ENDTOKEN
Toy soldiers falling ENDTOKEN
Dominoes, but who knows? ENDTOKEN

Yeah and I will coast through falling prayers ENDTOKEN
And all along the way ENDTOKEN
And I will always listen ENDTOKEN

On me ENDTOKEN

Bring it back, bring it back on ENDTOKEN
Bring it back, bring it back on ENDTOKEN
I missed you so much that I begged you to fly and see me ENDTOKEN
You must've broke down 'cause you finally said that you would ENDTOKEN
But now that you're here, I just feel like I'm constantly dreaming ENDTOKEN
'Cause something's gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good ENDTOKEN
For 48 hours, I don't think that we left my hotel room ENDTOKEN
Should show you the sights 'cause I'm sure that I said that I would ENDTOKEN
We gotta make love just one last time in the shower ENDTOKEN
Well, something's gotta go wrong 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good ENDTOKEN
And it's like, every time I turn around ENDTOKEN
I fall in love and find my heart face down and ENDTOKEN
Where it lands is where it should ENDTOKEN
This time it's like ENDTOKEN
The two of us should probably start to fight ENDTOKEN
'Cause something's gotta go wrong, 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good, oh ENDTOKEN
Feelin' way too damn good ENDTOKEN
Sometimes I think best if left in the memory ENDTOKEN
It's better kept inside than left for good ENDTOKEN
Looking back each time they tried to tell me ENDTOKEN
'Cause something's gotta go wrong, 'cause I'm feelin' way too damn good, oh ENDTOKEN
And it's like, every time I turn around ENDTOKEN
I fall in love and find my heart face down and ENDTOKEN
Where it lands is where it should ENDTOKEN
This time it's like ENDTOKEN
The two of us should probably start to fight ENDTOKEN

Feelin' way too damn good ENDTOKEN
(I missed you so much that I begged you to fly and see me) ENDTOKEN
Feelin' way too damn good ENDTOKEN
(I missed you so much that I begged you to fly and see me) ENDTOKEN
Yes, he wore a cowboy hat ENDTOKEN
Each bone broken in his back ENDTOKEN
All the money and all the gold ENDTOKEN
Couldn't buy my love at eight years old ENDTOKEN
Now I'm in love with a girl that's wrong for me ENDTOKEN
Ask her, she will disagree ENDTOKEN
Her father was a small town man ENDTOKEN
With small time dreams and small town hands ENDTOKEN
But... ENDTOKEN
But I was there when there was nobody home ENDTOKEN
Please believe me when I say, I don't know ENDTOKEN
Gone for good in fact, but what does it mean? ENDTOKEN
Within a year, they always sold them, but.. ENDTOKEN
Easy enough to just look at her ENDTOKEN
Whole world on a silver platter ENDTOKEN
What's that? Is that bad for me? ENDTOKEN
If I would set her conscience free ENDTOKEN
Won round one, but it's not over ENDTOKEN
He don't care cause he didn't know her ENDTOKEN
Too long it's not the same ENDTOKEN
If I could lend a hand in shame ENDTOKEN
But I was there when there was nobody home ENDTOKEN
Please believe me when I say, I don't know ENDTOKEN
Gone for good in fact, but what does it mean? ENDTOKEN
Within a year, they always sold them, but... ENDTOKEN
You'll always be ENDTOKEN
So much easier to see ENDTOKEN
Don't hide from me ENDTOKEN
That which I've already seen ENDTOKEN
You lie to me ENDTOKEN
More than occasionally ENDTOKEN
Don't lie to me ENDTOKEN
You lied to me ENDTOKEN
I'm as high as I'll ever be ENDTOKEN
I don't mind, stay and see ENDTOKEN
They've all gone, why don't we? ENDTOKEN
Lonely as you and me ENDTOKEN
But I'm as high as I'll ever be ENDTOKEN
Later on, last to see ENDTOKEN
My past is gone, only from me ENDTOKEN
I'm alive ENDTOKEN
But I was there when there was nobody home ENDTOKEN
Please believe me when I say, I don't know ENDTOKEN
Gone for good in fact, but what does it mean? ENDTOKEN
Within a year, they always sold them, but... ENDTOKEN
Remember when it was me ENDTOKEN
Driving has come down just for me ENDTOKEN
And then we'll try as we've been ENDTOKEN
Left on an eastbound train, gone first thing this morning ENDTOKEN
Why's what's best for you, always the worst thing for me? ENDTOKEN
When am I gonna learn? Why? 'Cause I'm tired of hating ENDTOKEN
When will it be your turn? Why? 'Cause I'm tired of waiting ENDTOKEN
No, I don't, no I don't, no I don't ENDTOKEN
Well no, I don't find faith in your forced feelings ENDTOKEN
Not fooled by your misleadings ENDTOKEN
Won't buy this line your selling ENDTOKEN
Tired of this lie your telling ENDTOKEN
I won't, I don't, no, I won't do this anymore ENDTOKEN
I won't, I don't, no, I won't do this anymore ENDTOKEN
She says I'm only tellin' half of it ENDTOKEN
That's probably because there's only half worth tellin' ENDTOKEN
And every time I try to laugh it off ENDTOKEN
That's when you turn around and wind up yellin' ENDTOKEN
When am I gonna learn? Why? 'Cause I'm tired of hating ENDTOKEN
When will it be your turn? Why? 'Cause I'm tired of waiting ENDTOKEN
No, I don't, no I don't, no I don't ENDTOKEN

I won't, I don't, no, I won't do this anymore ENDTOKEN
He was my best friend ENDTOKEN
Well, I tried to help him ENDTOKEN
But he traded everything for suffering ENDTOKEN
And found himself alone ENDTOKEN
I watched the lying turn into hiding ENDTOKEN
With scars on both his lips, his fingertips were melted to the bone ENDTOKEN
But I can still remember what his face looked like ENDTOKEN
When I found him in an alley in the middle of the night ENDTOKEN
Tell me what you know, tell me what you gone and done now ENDTOKEN
Tell me what you know, tell me what you gone and done now ENDTOKEN
A gun would do the trick, get it over with ENDTOKEN
You're better off ENDTOKEN
To take all you've got and burn it on the spot ENDTOKEN
To get high-igh-igh-igh (high-igh-igh-igh) ENDTOKEN
Three days no sleeping ENDTOKEN
Well, he gave up eating ENDTOKEN
He sold his mother's rings, she said nothing ENDTOKEN
And pretended not to know ENDTOKEN
He started stealing to supply the feeling ENDTOKEN
Found out he pulled a knife on someone's wife ENDTOKEN
And held it to her throat ENDTOKEN
But I can still remember what his face looked like ENDTOKEN
When I found him in an alley in the middle of the night ENDTOKEN
Tell me what you know, tell me what you gone and done now ENDTOKEN
Tell me what you know, tell me what you gone and done now ENDTOKEN
A gun would do the trick, get it over with ENDTOKEN
You're better off ENDTOKEN
To take all you've got and burn it on the spot ENDTOKEN
To get high-igh-igh-igh (high-igh-igh-igh) ENDTOKEN
Tell me what you did, where you gone and hid? ENDTOKEN
Show me is what you really want, watching what you've got ENDTOKEN
Slowly ENDTOKEN
Circling the drain, throw it all away ENDTOKEN
Just to get high-igh-igh-igh (high-igh-igh-igh) ENDTOKEN
High-igh, ohhh! ENDTOKEN
(High-igh-igh-igh, high-igh-igh-igh) ENDTOKEN
High ENDTOKEN

Circling the drain, throw it all away ENDTOKEN
Just to get high-igh-igh-igh ENDTOKEN
I woke up today in London ENDTOKEN
As the plane was touching down ENDTOKEN
And all I could think about was Monday ENDTOKEN
Maybe I'd be back around ENDTOKEN
If this keeps me away much longer ENDTOKEN
I don't know what I would do ENDTOKEN
You've got to understand it's a hard life ENDTOKEN
That I'm going through ENDTOKEN
And when the night falls in around me ENDTOKEN
I don't think I'll make it through ENDTOKEN
I'll use your light to guide the way ENDTOKEN
'Cause all I think about is you ENDTOKEN
Well, L.A. is getting kind of crazy ENDTOKEN
And New York is getting kind of cold ENDTOKEN
I keep my head from getting lazy ENDTOKEN
I just can't wait to get back home ENDTOKEN
And all these days I spend away ENDTOKEN
I'll make up for this, I swear ENDTOKEN
I need your love to hold me up ENDTOKEN
When it's all too much to bear ENDTOKEN
And when the night falls in around me ENDTOKEN
I don't think I'll make it through ENDTOKEN
I'll use your light to guide the way ENDTOKEN
'Cause all I think about is you ENDTOKEN
(Woah, woah) ENDTOKEN
And all these days I spend away ENDTOKEN
I'll make up for this, I swear ENDTOKEN
I need your love to hold me up ENDTOKEN
When it's all too much to bear ENDTOKEN
And when the night falls in around me ENDTOKEN
I don't think I'll make it through ENDTOKEN
I'll use your light to guide the way ENDTOKEN
'Cause all I think about is you ENDTOKEN
Got a criminal record, I can't cross state lines ENDTOKEN
First on the bad list, and you're last on mine ENDTOKEN
Lookin' for a scapegoat, long past due ENDTOKEN
Walking down the aisle, staring straight at you ENDTOKEN
I still hear him screaming "Where do I hide?" ENDTOKEN
And he asks and I say "Hurry inside" ENDTOKEN
He said, she said, no she don't ENDTOKEN
Be back before morning, You know she won't ENDTOKEN
I remember that summer, like yesterday ENDTOKEN
And I remember his mother, as he was dragged away ENDTOKEN
I still hear him screaming "Where do I hide?" ENDTOKEN
And he asks and I say "Hurry inside" ENDTOKEN
A whole lot of memories, yours and not mine ENDTOKEN
And he asks and I say "Hurry inside" ENDTOKEN
Got a criminal record, I can't cross state lines ENDTOKEN

And he asks and I say "Hurry inside" ENDTOKEN
A whole lot of memories, yours and not mine ENDTOKEN
And he asks and I say "Hurry inside" ENDTOKEN
"Where do I hide?" ENDTOKEN
Only in America ENDTOKEN
We're slaves to be free ENDTOKEN
Only in America we kill the unborn ENDTOKEN
To make ends meet ENDTOKEN
Only in America ENDTOKEN
Sexuality is democracy ENDTOKEN
Only in America we stamp our dollar ENDTOKEN
In God We Trust ENDTOKEN
What is right or wrong ENDTOKEN
I don't know who to believe in ENDTOKEN
My soul sings a different song ENDTOKEN
In America ENDTOKEN
What is right or wrong ENDTOKEN
I don't know who to believe in ENDTOKEN
My soul sings a different song ENDTOKEN
In America, In America, In America ENDTOKEN
Church bells ringing ENDTOKEN
Pass the plate around ENDTOKEN
The choir is singing ENDTOKEN
As their leader falls to the ground ENDTOKEN
Please mister prophet man ENDTOKEN
Tell me which way to go ENDTOKEN
I gave my last dollar ENDTOKEN
Can I still come to your show ENDTOKEN
I am right and you are wrong[x3] ENDTOKEN
No one's right and no one's wrong ENDTOKEN
In America, In America, In America, In America ENDTOKEN
At times life is wicked ENDTOKEN
And I just can't see the light ENDTOKEN
A silver lining sometimes isn't enough ENDTOKEN
To make some wrongs seem right ENDTOKEN
Whatever life brings ENDTOKEN
I've been through everything ENDTOKEN
And now I'm on my knees again ENDTOKEN
But I know, I must go on ENDTOKEN
Although I hurt, I must be strong ENDTOKEN
Because inside, I know ENDTOKEN
That many feel this way ENDTOKEN
Children, don't stop dancing ENDTOKEN
Believe you can fly away, away ENDTOKEN
At times life's unfair ENDTOKEN
And you know it's plain to see ENDTOKEN
Hey, God, I know I'm just a dot in this world ENDTOKEN
Have You forgot about me? ENDTOKEN
Whatever life brings ENDTOKEN
I've been through everything ENDTOKEN

Are we hiding in the shadows? ENDTOKEN
Hurray for a child that makes it through ENDTOKEN
If there's any way because the answer lies in you ENDTOKEN
They're laid to rest before they've known just what to do ENDTOKEN
Their souls are lost because ENDTOKEN
They could never find ENDTOKEN
What's this life for? What's this life for? ENDTOKEN
What's this life for? What's this life for? ENDTOKEN
I see your soul, it's kind of gray ENDTOKEN
You see my heart, you look away ENDTOKEN
You see my wrist, I know your pain ENDTOKEN
I know your purpose on your plane ENDTOKEN
Don't say a last prayer because ENDTOKEN
You could never find ENDTOKEN
I see your soul, it's kind of gray ENDTOKEN
You see my heart, you look away ENDTOKEN
You see my wrist, I know your pain ENDTOKEN
I know your purpose on your plane ENDTOKEN
Don't say a last prayer because ENDTOKEN
But they aren't here anymore ENDTOKEN
Don't have to settle the score ENDTOKEN
Because we all live under the reign ENDTOKEN
Of one king ENDTOKEN
But they aren't here anymore ENDTOKEN
Don't have to settle no goddamn score ENDTOKEN
Because we all live under the reign ENDTOKEN

I paid my last respects this mornin' on an early grave ENDTOKEN
Already said goodbye, nothin' left to say ENDTOKEN
A tiny church a tiny town and not a tear was spent ENDTOKEN
Not how I wanted it, I'm hating all of this ENDTOKEN
Well, I'm hating, all of this ENDTOKEN
I'm hating, all of this ENDTOKEN
All of this, all of this ENDTOKEN
Now I know why, I hide my love from you somedays ENDTOKEN
No, I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me ENDTOKEN
You came along, and tore this wall down around me ENDTOKEN
Looks like you found me ENDTOKEN
Now I know why ENDTOKEN
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning ENDTOKEN
I've been a loser all my life, I'm not about to change ENDTOKEN
If you don't like it, there's the door, nobody made you stay ENDTOKEN
There ain't a woman on the planet who can deal with it ENDTOKEN
Just how I wanted it, I'm hating all of this ENDTOKEN
Well, I'm hating, all of this ENDTOKEN
I'm hating, all of this ENDTOKEN
All of this, all of this ENDTOKEN

Never made it as a wise man ENDTOKEN
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing ENDTOKEN
Tired of living like a blind man ENDTOKEN
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling ENDTOKEN
And this is how you remind me ENDTOKEN
This is how you remind me of what I really am ENDTOKEN
This is how you remind me of what I really am ENDTOKEN
It's not like you to say sorry ENDTOKEN
I was waiting on a different story ENDTOKEN
This time I'm mistaken ENDTOKEN
For handing you a heart worth breaking ENDTOKEN
And I've been wrong, I've been down ENDTOKEN
Been to the bottom of every bottle ENDTOKEN
These five words in my head ENDTOKEN
Scream "Are we having fun yet?" ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no ENDTOKEN
It's not like you didn't know that ENDTOKEN
I said I love you and I swear I still do ENDTOKEN
And it must have been so bad ENDTOKEN
'Cause living with me must have damn near killed you ENDTOKEN
And this is how you remind me of what I really am ENDTOKEN
This is how you remind me of what I really am ENDTOKEN
It's not like you to say sorry ENDTOKEN
I was waiting on a different story ENDTOKEN
This time I'm mistaken ENDTOKEN
For handing you a heart worth breaking ENDTOKEN
And I've been wrong, I've been down ENDTOKEN
Been to the bottom of every bottle ENDTOKEN
These five words in my head ENDTOKEN
Scream "Are we having fun yet?" ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no ENDTOKEN
Never made it as a wise man ENDTOKEN
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing ENDTOKEN
And this is how you remind me ENDTOKEN
This is how you remind me ENDTOKEN
This is how you remind me of what I really am ENDTOKEN
This is how you remind me of what I really am ENDTOKEN
It's not like you to say sorry ENDTOKEN
I was waiting on a different story ENDTOKEN
This time I'm mistaken ENDTOKEN
For handing you a heart worth breaking ENDTOKEN
And I've been wrong, I've been down ENDTOKEN
Been to the bottom of every bottle ENDTOKEN
These five words in my head ENDTOKEN
Scream "Are we having fun yet?" ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah, are we having fun yet? ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah, are we having fun yet? ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah, are we having fun yet? ENDTOKEN
(These five words in my head) Yeah, yeah ENDTOKEN
No, no ENDTOKEN
I know it's late, but something's on my mind ENDTOKEN
It couldn't wait, there's never any time ENDTOKEN
'Cause life slips by without a warning ENDTOKEN
And I'm tired of ignoring ENDTOKEN
All the space that's between you and I ENDTOKEN
Let's lock the door behind us ENDTOKEN
They won't find us ENDTOKEN
Make the whole world wait ENDTOKEN
While we dance around this bedroom ENDTOKEN
Like we've only got tonight ENDTOKEN
Not about to let you ENDTOKEN
Go until the morning light ENDTOKEN
You can be my whole world, if I can be your satellite ENDTOKEN
Let's dance around this bedroom ENDTOKEN
Like tonight's our only night ENDTOKEN
Let's dance around this room (I'll be your satellite) ENDTOKEN
Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite) ENDTOKEN
Do you recall how long it must have been ENDTOKEN
Since any room held only you and me? ENDTOKEN
And every song that sings about it ENDTOKEN
Says that we can't live without it ENDTOKEN
Now I know just what that really means ENDTOKEN
Let's lock the door behind us ENDTOKEN
They won't find us ENDTOKEN
Make the whole world wait ENDTOKEN
While we dance around this bedroom ENDTOKEN
Like we've only got tonight ENDTOKEN
Not about to let you ENDTOKEN
Go until the morning light ENDTOKEN
You can be my whole world, if I can be your satellite ENDTOKEN
Let's dance around this bedroom ENDTOKEN
Like tonight's our only night ENDTOKEN
Let's dance around this room (I'll be your satellite) ENDTOKEN
Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite) ENDTOKEN
Dance with me around the moon (You and I, every night) ENDTOKEN
Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite) ENDTOKEN
I can't believe ENDTOKEN
The days turn into years ENDTOKEN
I hate to see ENDTOKEN
The moments disappear ENDTOKEN
But tonight the sand is stopping ENDTOKEN
Take the hourglass and drop it ENDTOKEN
So we can stay ENDTOKEN
Inside this atmosphere ENDTOKEN
Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite) ENDTOKEN
Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite) ENDTOKEN
Dance with me around the moon (You and I, every night) ENDTOKEN
Dance around this room  (I'll be your satellite) ENDTOKEN
Let's dance around this bedroom (I'll be your satellite) ENDTOKEN
Let's dance around this bedroom (I'll be your satellite) ENDTOKEN
Let's dance around this bedroom (I'll be your satellite) ENDTOKEN
Let's dance around this bedroom (I'll be your satellite) ENDTOKEN
Time is going by so much faster than I ENDTOKEN
And I'm starting to regret not spending all of it with you ENDTOKEN
Now I'm wondering why I've kept this bottled inside ENDTOKEN
So I'm starting to regret not telling all of it to you ENDTOKEN
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know ENDTOKEN
You're never gonna be alone ENDTOKEN
From this moment on ENDTOKEN
If you ever feel like letting go ENDTOKEN
I won't let you fall ENDTOKEN
You're never gonna be alone ENDTOKEN
I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone ENDTOKEN
And now as long as I can, I'm holding on with both hands ENDTOKEN
'Cause forever I believe that there's nothing I could need but you ENDTOKEN
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know ENDTOKEN
You're never gonna be alone ENDTOKEN
From this moment on ENDTOKEN
If you ever feel like letting go ENDTOKEN
I won't let you fall ENDTOKEN
When all hope is gone, I know that you can carry on ENDTOKEN
We’re gonna take the world on ENDTOKEN
I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone ENDTOKEN
Oh! ENDTOKEN
You've gotta live every single day ENDTOKEN
Like it's the only one, what if tomorrow never comes? ENDTOKEN
Don't let it slip away ENDTOKEN
Could be our only one, you know it's only just begun ENDTOKEN
Every single day ENDTOKEN
Maybe our only one, what if tomorrow never comes? ENDTOKEN
Tomorrow never comes ENDTOKEN
Time is going by so much faster than I ENDTOKEN
And I'm starting to regret not telling all of this to you ENDTOKEN
You're never gonna be alone ENDTOKEN
From this moment on ENDTOKEN
If you ever feel like letting go ENDTOKEN
I won't let you fall ENDTOKEN
When all hope is gone, I know that you can carry on ENDTOKEN
We’re gonna take the world on ENDTOKEN
I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone ENDTOKEN
I'm gonna be there always ENDTOKEN
I won't be missing one more day ENDTOKEN
I'm gonna be there always ENDTOKEN
I won't be missing one more day ENDTOKEN
Lost it on the chesterfield ENDTOKEN
Or maybe on a gambling wheel ENDTOKEN
Lost it in a diamond mine ENDTOKEN
It's dark as hell and hard to find ENDTOKEN
You can climb to the top of the highest tree ENDTOKEN
You can look around, but you still won't see ENDTOKEN
What I'm looking for ENDTOKEN
Where the good times gone? ENDTOKEN
Where the good times gone? ENDTOKEN
All the stupid fun ENDTOKEN
And all that shit we've done ENDTOKEN
Where the good times gone? ENDTOKEN
Well, I still don't know ENDTOKEN
Out in the back in the old corn field ENDTOKEN
Underneath the tractor wheel ENDTOKEN
Thought I'd dig, till I'd found it first ENDTOKEN
Broke my back and died of thirst ENDTOKEN
You can bribe the devil, you can pray to God ENDTOKEN
You can sell off everything you got ENDTOKEN
And you still won't know ENDTOKEN
Where the good times gone? ENDTOKEN
Where the good times gone? ENDTOKEN
All the stupid fun ENDTOKEN
And all that shit we've done ENDTOKEN
Where the good times gone? ENDTOKEN
Well, I still don't know ENDTOKEN
Saw it on the silver screen ENDTOKEN
Preacher says, "Don't know what it means" ENDTOKEN
Last page ad in a comic book ENDTOKEN
Bought me a map, showed me where to look ENDTOKEN
It ain't carved of stone or made of wood ENDTOKEN
And if you paid for it, then it ain't no good ENDTOKEN
And you still won't know ENDTOKEN
What I'm looking for ENDTOKEN
Oh, where the good times gone? ENDTOKEN
Where the good times gone? ENDTOKEN
All the stupid fun ENDTOKEN
And all that shit we've done ENDTOKEN
Where the good times gone? ENDTOKEN
Oh yeah ENDTOKEN
Manhunt to find your daughter ENDTOKEN
Buried underneath the water ENDTOKEN
Now they consult a psychic ENDTOKEN
Find how much I like it ENDTOKEN
And now I've found a little friend ENDTOKEN
And now it's just you and me ENDTOKEN
Borrow one and we will make three ENDTOKEN
I say we steal one more ENDTOKEN
Just like we did once before ENDTOKEN
And now I've found a little friend ENDTOKEN
Doesn't rest, this won't last ENDTOKEN
And you touch as too much, running now ENDTOKEN
And now I've found a little friend ENDTOKEN
And now I thought I told her ENDTOKEN
That she won't get much older ENDTOKEN
And now I've found a little friend ENDTOKEN
And now it makes no difference ENDTOKEN
'Cause I am not quite in yet ENDTOKEN
And now it's on the table ENDTOKEN
'Cause she's perfectly able ENDTOKEN
And now I've found a little friend ENDTOKEN
Walking around I hear the sounds of the earth seeking relief ENDTOKEN
I'm trying to find a reason to live ENDTOKEN
But the mindless clutter my path ENDTOKEN
Oh, these thorns in my side ENDTOKEN
Oh, these thorns in my side ENDTOKEN
I know I have something free ENDTOKEN
I have something so alive ENDTOKEN
But I think they shoot because they want ENDTOKEN
I think they shoot because they want ENDTOKEN
I think they shoot because they want me ENDTOKEN
I feel forces all around me ENDTOKEN
Come on raise your head ENDTOKEN
Those who hide behind the shadows ENDTOKEN
Live with all that's dead ENDTOKEN
Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me ENDTOKEN
At least look at me when you shoot ENDTOKEN
A bullet through my head ENDTOKEN
Through my head, through my head ENDTOKEN
In my lifetime when I'm disgraced ENDTOKEN
Jealousy and lies ENDTOKEN
I laugh aloud because my life ENDTOKEN
Has gotten inside someone else's mind ENDTOKEN
Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me ENDTOKEN
At least look at me when you shoot ENDTOKEN
A bullet through my head ENDTOKEN
Through my head, through my head ENDTOKEN
Hey, all I want is what's real ENDTOKEN
Something I touch and can feel ENDTOKEN
I'll hold it close and never let it go ENDTOKEN
Said why, why do we live this life ENDTOKEN
With all this hate inside? ENDTOKEN
I'll give it away ENDTOKEN
Because I don't want it no more ENDTOKEN
Please help me find a place ENDTOKEN
Somewhere far away ENDTOKEN
Yes, I'll go and you'll never see me again ENDTOKEN
Look at me, look at me ENDTOKEN
At least look at me when you shoot ENDTOKEN
A bullet through my head ENDTOKEN
Through my head, through my head ENDTOKEN
Look at me, look at me ENDTOKEN
At least look at me when you shoot ENDTOKEN
A bullet through my head ENDTOKEN
Through my head, through my head ENDTOKEN
Look at me ENDTOKEN
Look at me ENDTOKEN
I think I was better off before this all began ENDTOKEN
So clearly I can see lately that you don't know who I am ENDTOKEN
Everybody tried to tell me something that I never could believe ENDTOKEN
Stand back, it seems so much different than it did in front of me ENDTOKEN
But I know ENDTOKEN
There's no good in lookin' back on yesterday ENDTOKEN
And wondering what could have happened then ENDTOKEN
You think you can give me what I want ENDTOKEN
You say, you say ENDTOKEN
I think i'm better off alone ENDTOKEN
These days, these days ENDTOKEN
Why should I put my trust in something that I never could believe ENDTOKEN
So one day you can find somethin' better just to pack your things and leave? ENDTOKEN
Loneliness is a friend for the moment, but you won't walk out on me ENDTOKEN
I know ENDTOKEN
There's no good in lookin' back on yesterday ENDTOKEN
And wondering what could have happened then ENDTOKEN
You think you can give me what I want ENDTOKEN
You say, you say ENDTOKEN
I think i'm better off alone ENDTOKEN
These days, these days ENDTOKEN
I'm tired and I'm sick of waiting ENDTOKEN
Maybe I'll die alone ENDTOKEN
'Cause I can't take another damn day ENDTOKEN
Of waiting here for you to come home to me ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah, baby, baby please ENDTOKEN
Tell me why ENDTOKEN
You think you can give me what I want ENDTOKEN
You say, you say ENDTOKEN
I think I'm better off alone ENDTOKEN
These days, these days ENDTOKEN
You think you can give me what I want ENDTOKEN
You say, you say ENDTOKEN
I think I'm better off alone ENDTOKEN
These days, these days ENDTOKEN
Looking back at the beginning of this ENDTOKEN
And how life was ENDTOKEN
Just you and me and love and all of our friends ENDTOKEN
Living life like an ocean ENDTOKEN
Now the currents slowly pulling me down ENDTOKEN
It's getting harder to breath ENDTOKEN
It won't be too long and I'll be going under ENDTOKEN
Can you save me from this ENDTOKEN
It's not my time ENDTOKEN
I'm not going ENDTOKEN
There's a fear in me ENDTOKEN
It's not showing ENDTOKEN
This could be the end of me ENDTOKEN
And everything I know ENDTOKEN
Oh, I won't go ENDTOKEN
I look ahead to all the plans that we made ENDTOKEN
And the dreams that we had ENDTOKEN
I'm in a world that tries to take them away ENDTOKEN
Oh, but I'm taking them back ENDTOKEN
All this time I've just been to blind to understand ENDTOKEN
What should matter to me ENDTOKEN
My friend, this life we live ENDTOKEN
Is not what we have, it's what we believe ENDTOKEN
It's not my time ENDTOKEN
I'm not going ENDTOKEN
There's a fear in me ENDTOKEN
It's not showing ENDTOKEN
This could be the end of me ENDTOKEN
And everything I know ENDTOKEN
Oh, It's not my time ENDTOKEN
I'm not going ENDTOKEN
There's a fear in me ENDTOKEN
Now I know that ENDTOKEN
This could be the end of me ENDTOKEN
And everything I know ENDTOKEN
Oh, I won't go ENDTOKEN
I won't go ENDTOKEN
It might be more than you believe ENDTOKEN
It might be something you can't see ENDTOKEN
It's not my time ENDTOKEN
I'm not going ENDTOKEN
There's a fear in me ENDTOKEN
It's not showing ENDTOKEN
This could be the end of me ENDTOKEN
And everything I know ENDTOKEN
It's not my time ENDTOKEN
I'm not going ENDTOKEN
There's a will in me ENDTOKEN
Now it's gonna show ENDTOKEN
This could be the end of me ENDTOKEN
And everything I know ENDTOKEN
I won't go ENDTOKEN
There might be more than you believe ENDTOKEN
There might be more than you can see ENDTOKEN
It's not my time ENDTOKEN
I'm not going ENDTOKEN
There's a fear in me ENDTOKEN
It's not showing ENDTOKEN
This could be the end of me ENDTOKEN
And everything I know ENDTOKEN
It's not my time ENDTOKEN
I'm not going ENDTOKEN
There's a will in me ENDTOKEN
Now I know it ENDTOKEN
This could be the end of me ENDTOKEN
And everything I know ENDTOKEN
I won't go ENDTOKEN
I won't go! ENDTOKEN
No I wooooon't gooooo down! ENDTOKEN
They gave me a life that's not so easy to live ENDTOKEN
And then they sent me on my way ENDTOKEN
I left my love and forgot my dreams ENDTOKEN
I lost them along the way ENDTOKEN
Those little things you say ENDTOKEN
When words mean so much ENDTOKEN
You never back down ENDTOKEN
And they all shy away ENDTOKEN
You always listen to me ENDTOKEN
And what do I get to get me through these sleepless nights? ENDTOKEN
And what do I have to hold when no one's there to hold me tight? ENDTOKEN
And what do I see? ENDTOKEN
The only thing that gets me through ENDTOKEN
This is what I feel and I feel you ENDTOKEN
And this ain't no bed of nails ENDTOKEN
But they're not roses just the same ENDTOKEN
God, this road sure can be long ENDTOKEN
Another endless day, another seven hundred miles ENDTOKEN
That'll take me further from my home ENDTOKEN
Those little things you say ENDTOKEN
When words mean so much ENDTOKEN
You never back down ENDTOKEN
And they all shy away ENDTOKEN
You always listen to me ENDTOKEN
And what do I get to get me through these sleepless nights? ENDTOKEN
And what do I have to hold when no one's there to hold me tight? ENDTOKEN
And what do I see? ENDTOKEN
The only thing that gets me through ENDTOKEN
This is what I feel and I feel you ENDTOKEN
I know what you're going through now ENDTOKEN
Believe me, I live this ENDTOKEN
And what do I get to get me through these sleepless nights? ENDTOKEN
And what do I have to hold when no one's there to hold me tight? ENDTOKEN
And what do I see? ENDTOKEN
The only thing that gets me through ENDTOKEN
This is what I feel and I feel you ENDTOKEN
{Inaudible Chatter} ENDTOKEN
Ohh! ENDTOKEN
Lookin' like another Bob Marley day ENDTOKEN
Hittin' from the bong like a diesel train ENDTOKEN
And I'm down with hangin' out this afternoon ENDTOKEN
We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall ENDTOKEN
Cheech and Chong probably woulda' smoked them all ENDTOKEN
So I'm out on the couch this afternoon ENDTOKEN
Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor ENDTOKEN
If we take 'em all back, we can buy some more ENDTOKEN
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon ENDTOKEN
Ohh! ENDTOKEN
You better hang on if you're taggin' along ENDTOKEN
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin' ENDTOKEN
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long ENDTOKEN
Tough to put the brakes on ENDTOKEN
Doesn't matter when you'd rather ENDTOKEN
Get up, and go out ENDTOKEN
Me and all my friends ENDTOKEN
We drink up, we fall down ENDTOKEN
And then we do it all again ENDTOKEN
Just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon ENDTOKEN
Landlord says I should buy a tent ENDTOKEN
But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent ENDTOKEN
So I doubt he'll kick me out this afternoon ENDTOKEN
Down on the corner in a seedy bar ENDTOKEN
Juke box crankin' out the CCR ENDTOKEN
Had a few to Suzy Q this afternoon ENDTOKEN
Ohh! ENDTOKEN
You better hang on if you're taggin' along ENDTOKEN
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin' ENDTOKEN
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long ENDTOKEN
Tough to put the brakes on ENDTOKEN
Doesn't matter when you'd rather ENDTOKEN
Get up, and go out ENDTOKEN
Me and all my friends ENDTOKEN
We drink up, we fall down ENDTOKEN
And then we do it all again ENDTOKEN
Yeah, we get up, and go out ENDTOKEN
Me and all my friends ENDTOKEN
We drink up, we fall down ENDTOKEN
And then we do it all again ENDTOKEN
Yeah, just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon ENDTOKEN
Don't want a wristwatch or an alarm clock ENDTOKEN
To see what time it is ENDTOKEN
From the moment I wake up ENDTOKEN
I just love being with my friends ENDTOKEN
We barely get by, but have the best times ENDTOKEN
And hope it never ends ENDTOKEN
We drink all day till we fall down ENDTOKEN
So we can do it all again ENDTOKEN
It's not the human walk ENDTOKEN
It's the human race ENDTOKEN
If you ain't livin' on the edge ENDTOKEN
You're takin' too much space ENDTOKEN
So I doubt I'll figure out just what to do ENDTOKEN
'Bout to kick it around ENDTOKEN
Hanging out this afternoon ENDTOKEN
Ohh! ENDTOKEN
You better hang on if you're taggin' along ENDTOKEN
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin' ENDTOKEN
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long ENDTOKEN
Tough to put the brakes on ENDTOKEN
Doesn't matter when you'd rather ENDTOKEN
Get up, and go out ENDTOKEN
Me and all my friends ENDTOKEN
We drink up, we fall down ENDTOKEN
And then we do it all again ENDTOKEN
Yeah, we get up, and go out ENDTOKEN
Me and all my friends ENDTOKEN
We drink up, we fall down ENDTOKEN
And then we do it all again ENDTOKEN
Just kickin' around, hangin' out this afternoon ENDTOKEN
{Laughter} ENDTOKEN
Sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon ENDTOKEN
(Last call, you sons of bitches!) ENDTOKEN
Just kickin' around, hangin' out this afternoon ENDTOKEN
Yeah, just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon ENDTOKEN
(Drinks on the house!) ENDTOKEN
Just kickin' around, hangin' out this afternoon ENDTOKEN
Just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon ENDTOKEN
Best of friends; where'd they all go? ENDTOKEN
Try and find, but no one ever knows ENDTOKEN
This small town makes you wanna stay ENDTOKEN
Who the hell would want to anyway? ENDTOKEN
Well. I'm leaving ENDTOKEN
And I want it all ENDTOKEN
Thought I got ENDTOKEN
Better find this all ENDTOKEN
And I found out where it's all at ENDTOKEN
And I want it all ENDTOKEN
Thought I got ENDTOKEN
Better find this all ENDTOKEN
And I found out where it's all at ENDTOKEN
Better now than I'm before ENDTOKEN
Tried it once now I want it more ENDTOKEN
Memories all cut in half ENDTOKEN
Tell the truth then I want you to laugh ENDTOKEN
We're not laughing ENDTOKEN
And I want it all ENDTOKEN
Thought I got ENDTOKEN
Better find this all ENDTOKEN
And I found out where it's all at ENDTOKEN
Burn it all ENDTOKEN
Watch and learn ENDTOKEN
Sell it all watch and learn ENDTOKEN
Sell it all watch it burn ENDTOKEN
Steal a car ENDTOKEN
We're all headed south ENDTOKEN
You know the score so just shut your mouth ENDTOKEN
One more run then I want out ENDTOKEN
Not like them I'd rather go without ENDTOKEN
Without needing ENDTOKEN
And I want it all ENDTOKEN
Thought I got ENDTOKEN
Better find this all ENDTOKEN
And I found out where it's all at ENDTOKEN
Well I knew it all ENDTOKEN
Forgot it all ENDTOKEN
Better find this all ENDTOKEN
And I found out where it's all at ENDTOKEN
The dust has finally settled on the field of Human Clay ENDTOKEN
Just enough light has shown through ENDTOKEN
To tell the night from the day ENDTOKEN
We are incomplete and hollow ENDTOKEN
For our maker has gone away ENDTOKEN
Who is to blame? ENDTOKEN
We'll surely melt in the rain ENDTOKEN
Say I, Say I[x3] ENDTOKEN
The stillness is so lifeless with no spirit in your soul ENDTOKEN
Like children with no vision do exactly what they're told ENDTOKEN
Being led into the desert ENDTOKEN
For your strength will surely fade ENDTOKEN
Who is to blame? ENDTOKEN
We'll surely melt in the rain ENDTOKEN
Say I, Say I[x6] ENDTOKEN
Frantic, faction, focus ENDTOKEN
(Frantic, Focus) ENDTOKEN
The world breathes ENDTOKEN
And out forms this misconception we call man ENDTOKEN
(We speak, they don't own us) ENDTOKEN
But I don't know him ENDTOKEN
(So look) ENDTOKEN
No, I don't know him ENDTOKEN
(Inside) ENDTOKEN
Because he lies ENDTOKEN
(And See) ENDTOKEN
They Lie ENDTOKEN
Say I, yeah[x5] ENDTOKEN
You said that mountains too high ENDTOKEN
You said that oceans too wide ENDTOKEN
I've heard all new beginnings ENDTOKEN
Started with an end ENDTOKEN
Watch this journey I take ENDTOKEN
Turn into something I make ENDTOKEN
Please watch closely ENDTOKEN
You may not see this again ENDTOKEN
Cause I, know I ENDTOKEN
I was born to be this way ENDTOKEN
Everyday I try and I'll do ENDTOKEN
Everything that it takes ENDTOKEN
To become the one ENDTOKEN
What I've always wanted to be ENDTOKEN
Watch right now ENDTOKEN
And you will see the champion in me ENDTOKEN
The champion in me ENDTOKEN
When the others cower ENDTOKEN
I'm in my finest hour ENDTOKEN
We are champions created by design ENDTOKEN
While I remember falling ENDTOKEN
I hear these dreams keep calling ENDTOKEN
I work so hard, so long ENDTOKEN
I'll take it what is mine ENDTOKEN
Champion, champion in me ENDTOKEN
Champion, champion ENDTOKEN
Whenever the lights go down ENDTOKEN
That's when she comes alive ENDTOKEN
Ooh ooh ENDTOKEN
Maybe it's just something that you can only see in the light ENDTOKEN
Ooh ooh ENDTOKEN
A pretty little vixen dancing out on the scene ENDTOKEN
But the lights are shining, so she's keeping it clean ENDTOKEN
Don't get too close ENDTOKEN
Boy, don't touch her skin ENDTOKEN
Or you'll never feel the same way again ENDTOKEN
If everything you see is what you're believing ENDTOKEN
Then she'll be holding your heart ENDTOKEN
And by the time the sun goes down ENDTOKEN
You won't know who you are ENDTOKEN
She likes to do it in the dark ENDTOKEN
She likes to do it in the dark, oh ENDTOKEN
Whenever the darkness comes, she'll have you right where she wants ENDTOKEN
Ooh ooh ENDTOKEN
Just when you think it's all over ENDTOKEN
It's where it all starts ENDTOKEN
It sounds like an angel is calling my name ENDTOKEN
It might be the devil, but they all sound the same ENDTOKEN
And all her moves won't let you get away ENDTOKEN
She's gonna make your mind come with you to stay ENDTOKEN
If everything you see is what you're believing ENDTOKEN
Then she'll be holding your heart ENDTOKEN
And by the time the sun goes down ENDTOKEN
You won't know who you are ENDTOKEN
She likes to do it in the dark ENDTOKEN
She likes to do it in the dark, oh ENDTOKEN
She likes to do it in the dark ENDTOKEN
Oh oh, oh oh ENDTOKEN
Ooh ooh ooh ENDTOKEN
If everything you see is what you're believing ENDTOKEN
Then she'll be holding your heart ENDTOKEN
And by the time the sun goes down ENDTOKEN
You won't know who you are ENDTOKEN
She is gonna make you think you were leading ENDTOKEN
But she had you from the start ENDTOKEN
And by the time the sun goes down ENDTOKEN
You won't know who you are ENDTOKEN
She likes to do it in the dark ENDTOKEN
She likes to do it in the dark ENDTOKEN
She likes to do it in the dark, oh ENDTOKEN
Oh ENDTOKEN

Distant light somewhere ahead ENDTOKEN
All alone caught in between ENDTOKEN

It's going to rain some days I know ENDTOKEN
And things are going to hurt sometimes that's for sure ENDTOKEN
But I won't get turned around cause I keep moving on ENDTOKEN
I think my mind plays tricks on me ENDTOKEN
Cause sometimes what I get ain't what I see ENDTOKEN
I just turn it upside down and I keep moving on ENDTOKEN
I'm going to race for the morning sun ENDTOKEN
I can't wait for the day that's on it's way ENDTOKEN
I'm going to race for the morning sun ENDTOKEN
And it's going to shine on me ENDTOKEN
Oh, it's going to shine ENDTOKEN

I'm going to race for the sun ENDTOKEN
There's a difference in spending time with me ENDTOKEN
And killing time while I'm there ENDTOKEN
On too many people and too many things ENDTOKEN
And it makes me feel like hell ENDTOKEN
You have gone as I can see ENDTOKEN
And all of this she says to me ENDTOKEN
There's too many questions ENDTOKEN
And too many strings ENDTOKEN
And they won't keep their self tied ENDTOKEN
On a roller coaster ride ENDTOKEN
It feels like I'm lying next to a ghost at night ENDTOKEN
I don't know why I gave you my heart ENDTOKEN
Cause sometimes it feels so wrong ENDTOKEN
But despite of all this weather ENDTOKEN
I know why we are together ENDTOKEN
And I swear right now ENDTOKEN
I'm right where I belong ENDTOKEN
I know I get a little bit crazy ENDTOKEN
But I never done you no wrong ENDTOKEN
Well I get distracted and carried away ENDTOKEN
And it's been this way too long ENDTOKEN
But I don't know what you need from me ENDTOKEN
Cause all I know is what I can see ENDTOKEN
There's too many questions ENDTOKEN
And too many strings ENDTOKEN
And they won't keep their self tied ENDTOKEN
On a roller coaster ride ENDTOKEN
It feels like I'm lying next to a ghost at night ENDTOKEN
I don't know why I gave you my heart ENDTOKEN
Cause sometimes it feels so wrong ENDTOKEN
But despite of all this weather ENDTOKEN
I know why we are together ENDTOKEN
And I swear right now ENDTOKEN
I'm right where I belong ENDTOKEN
I'm right where I belong ENDTOKEN
Go on, Play it for me Son ENDTOKEN
There's too many questions ENDTOKEN
And too many strings ENDTOKEN
And they won't keep their self tied ENDTOKEN
On a roller coaster ride ENDTOKEN
It feels like I'm lying next to a ghost at night ENDTOKEN
I don't know why I gave you my heart ENDTOKEN
Cause sometimes it feels so wrong ENDTOKEN
But despite of all this weather ENDTOKEN
I know why we are together ENDTOKEN
And I swear right now ENDTOKEN
I'm right where I belong ENDTOKEN
Keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel[x2] ENDTOKEN
Yeah, we're going to the roadhouse, going to have a real good time ENDTOKEN
Yeah, the back of the roadhouse, they got some bungalows[x2] ENDTOKEN
And that's for the people who like to go down slow ENDTOKEN
Let it roll, baby, roll[x3] ENDTOKEN
Let it roll all night long ENDTOKEN
You've got to roll, roll, roll ENDTOKEN
You've got to thrill my soul, all right ENDTOKEN
Roll, roll, roll, roll ENDTOKEN
Thrill my soul ENDTOKEN
Ashen lady[x2] ENDTOKEN
Give up your vows[x2] ENDTOKEN
Save our city[x2] ENDTOKEN
Right now ENDTOKEN
When I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer[x2] ENDTOKEN
The future's uncertain and the end is always near ENDTOKEN
She's old enough ENDTOKEN
She knows enough ENDTOKEN
She's thrown up ENDTOKEN
So throw her ENDTOKEN
Out to me ENDTOKEN
And I'll treat her like she was mine ENDTOKEN
Not my belief ENDTOKEN
You got your way and I'll get mine ENDTOKEN
And I can't eat ENDTOKEN
I can't sleep ENDTOKEN
Oh, but thank you for coming ENDTOKEN
And why do we always laugh ENDTOKEN
While we're in this discussion? ENDTOKEN
Should have known enough ENDTOKEN
Never grown enough ENDTOKEN
Alone enough ENDTOKEN
To know my ENDTOKEN
Way will be ENDTOKEN
The path I wanted to try ENDTOKEN
If it fairs to be ENDTOKEN
Good for me, than I'd rather die ENDTOKEN
And I can't eat ENDTOKEN
I can't sleep ENDTOKEN
Oh, but thank you for coming ENDTOKEN
And why do we always laugh ENDTOKEN
While we're in this discussion? ENDTOKEN
Black words always lead to something ENDTOKEN
Bury her 'cause her time was cut thin ENDTOKEN
All the while you just stood and stared ENDTOKEN
Never cared to help we just got carried away ENDTOKEN
Lately it seems like my dreams have started to die ENDTOKEN
It occurred to me on the inside, I guess so have I ENDTOKEN
And I can't eat ENDTOKEN
I can't sleep ENDTOKEN
Oh, but thank you for coming ENDTOKEN
And why do we always laugh ENDTOKEN
While we're in this discussion? ENDTOKEN
Standing here with my two feet ENDTOKEN
Enjoy it now because it won't be ENDTOKEN
Some way, some how ENDTOKEN
The things that keep me alive ENDTOKEN
Aren't living here anymore ENDTOKEN
You say this will be alright ENDTOKEN
Just put my faith in you ENDTOKEN
Let you have another try ENDTOKEN
And show me all that you can do ENDTOKEN
But now here we go again ENDTOKEN
Back down a dead-end street ENDTOKEN
I'm hoping maybe this time though ENDTOKEN
The truth and the lies might meet ENDTOKEN
But I don't think they'll get along ENDTOKEN
If I didn't know that look ENDTOKEN
In your eyes so well ENDTOKEN
Then maybe I could play your game ENDTOKEN
And believe the lies you tell ENDTOKEN
You say this is for my good ENDTOKEN
Well my good could use some help ENDTOKEN
You promised me my heaven ENDTOKEN
But I'm living in your hell ENDTOKEN
Maybe in another life ENDTOKEN
And maybe I can find you there ENDTOKEN
Or maybe we can make this right ENDTOKEN
Or maybe I just wouldn't care ENDTOKEN
I've taken this long enough ENDTOKEN
And I can't go on this way ENDTOKEN
So I guess it's over now ENDTOKEN
There's only one thing left to say ENDTOKEN
It's time to be moving on ENDTOKEN
If I didn't know that look ENDTOKEN
In your eyes so well ENDTOKEN
Then maybe I could play your game ENDTOKEN
And believe the lies you tell ENDTOKEN
You say this is for my good ENDTOKEN
Well my good could use some help ENDTOKEN
You promised me my heaven ENDTOKEN
But I'm living in your hell ENDTOKEN
You only want someone to blame ENDTOKEN
But that's just who you are ENDTOKEN
Well all I wanted to find was something beautiful ENDTOKEN
I thought that I had found something to last forever ENDTOKEN
But all there was to find is you're no better ENDTOKEN
You're no better ENDTOKEN
You're no better ENDTOKEN
You're no better ENDTOKEN
If I didn't know that look ENDTOKEN
In your eyes so well ENDTOKEN
Then maybe I could play your game ENDTOKEN
And believe the lies you tell ENDTOKEN
You say this is for my good ENDTOKEN
Well my good could use some help ENDTOKEN
You promised me my heaven ENDTOKEN
But you know this too well ENDTOKEN
You say this is for my good ENDTOKEN
Well my good could use some help ENDTOKEN
You promised me my heaven ENDTOKEN
But I'm living in your hell ENDTOKEN
And you see much better than I see ENDTOKEN
And you know all that I'm thinking ENDTOKEN
To define or redefine too slow ENDTOKEN
And it seems all that I'm sinking ENDTOKEN
Running through the deep ENDTOKEN
Going to find the backwoods ENDTOKEN
I found out ENDTOKEN
All day long, who will be the big men giving some? ENDTOKEN
And you bleed much better than I bleed ENDTOKEN
And you've shown all that is so good ENDTOKEN
And your word, much better than my word ENDTOKEN
And you stand right where a hole should ENDTOKEN
Running through the deep ENDTOKEN
Going to find the backwoods ENDTOKEN
I found out ENDTOKEN
All day long who will be the big men giving some ENDTOKEN
Oh, yeah ENDTOKEN
Oh, yeah ENDTOKEN
To feel divine ENDTOKEN
To hold onto one’s self ENDTOKEN
To give and to give and ENDTOKEN
To never receive by myself ENDTOKEN
Running through the deep (I want it) ENDTOKEN
Going to find the backwoods (I need it) ENDTOKEN
I found out (Much more than he did) ENDTOKEN
All day long who will be the big men giving some ENDTOKEN
(Give it back somehow) ENDTOKEN
Giving some (I'm ready to forgive now) ENDTOKEN
Running through the deep ENDTOKEN
Going to find the backwoods ENDTOKEN
I found out ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah ENDTOKEN
All day long who will be the big men giving some ENDTOKEN
Running through the deep going to find the back backwoods ENDTOKEN
I found out, gonna get it, gonna get it ENDTOKEN
All day long who will be the big men? ENDTOKEN
Are you really, really gonna get it? ENDTOKEN
Well, the lady and me both agree some days we just don't get along ENDTOKEN
But the whiskey and me both agree maybe we're both just better off ENDTOKEN
Well, the preacher believes I don't need all of these demons hanging on ENDTOKEN
But we both know if they don't, I'll get lonely, need a few to tag along ENDTOKEN
Hanging here by a thread ENDTOKEN
Hear your voice inside my head ENDTOKEN
I lay beside you every night ENDTOKEN
And dread the day you might be gone ENDTOKEN
She said, "In case you hadn't noticed that ENDTOKEN
Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long (no) ENDTOKEN
And I ain't about to anymore" ENDTOKEN
Yeah ENDTOKEN
Well, the wagon I'm in is paper thin ENDTOKEN
I think one wheel's coming off ENDTOKEN
Hey sister sin with that grin, where you been? ENDTOKEN
So kind of you to help me off ENDTOKEN
Hanging here by a thread ENDTOKEN
Hear your voice inside my head ENDTOKEN
I lay beside you every night ENDTOKEN
And dread the day you might be gone ENDTOKEN
She said, "In case you hadn't noticed that ENDTOKEN
Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long (no) ENDTOKEN
And I ain't about to anymore" ENDTOKEN
Fall from grace, kingdom come ENDTOKEN
Laying face down in the mud ENDTOKEN
Please don't hate, Lord don't judge ENDTOKEN
For I know not just what I've done ENDTOKEN
Fall from grace, kingdom come ENDTOKEN
Laying face down in the mud ENDTOKEN
Please don't hate, Lord don't judge ENDTOKEN

Stuck in a cage, luck of the draw ENDTOKEN
Hours to wait, gotta get out ENDTOKEN
Lord, I gotta fight one ENDTOKEN
Get me a key, pick me a lock ENDTOKEN
Gotta be free, ready or not ENDTOKEN
Gotta run, gotta run ENDTOKEN
Gotta run, gotta run ENDTOKEN
Gotta run, gotta run ENDTOKEN
Nowhere to hide 'cause someone's always gonna find you ENDTOKEN
Trying to breathe with everybody right behind you ENDTOKEN
Scattering leaves to try and cover up the footprints ENDTOKEN

I'm running for the river ENDTOKEN
'Cause the river's running high and there ain't no goin' back ENDTOKEN
They'll never catch me ENDTOKEN

Let out the hounds, stand off the guards ENDTOKEN

I've got no time to move ahead ENDTOKEN
Have you heard one thing that I’ve said ENDTOKEN

A freshly stolen Mustang small block 302 ENDTOKEN

There I was, laid out on a table ENDTOKEN
Screamin' sweat and bare feet to the floor ENDTOKEN
In my life, I'd not soften ENDTOKEN
Things that cut, and burn so often ENDTOKEN
But I sit, think of somethin' ENDTOKEN
Scared to face, the dyin' nothin' ENDTOKEN
See the cycle I've waited for ENDTOKEN
It ain't like that anymore ENDTOKEN
Where I go is when I feel I'm able ENDTOKEN
How I fight is why I'm feelin' sore ENDTOKEN
In my Mind, not forgotten ENDTOKEN
Feel as though, a tooth were rotten ENDTOKEN
Behind the smile, a tongue that's slippin' ENDTOKEN
Buzzards cry, when flesh is rippin' ENDTOKEN
See the cycle I've waited for ENDTOKEN
It ain't like that anymore ENDTOKEN
Here I sit writing on the paper ENDTOKEN
Trying to think of words you can't ignore ENDTOKEN
In my eyes, what I'm lacking ENDTOKEN
Score at face, a ten for slacking ENDTOKEN
Sign the deal, set in motion ENDTOKEN
Smaller fish, so huge the ocean ENDTOKEN
See the cycle I've waited for ENDTOKEN
It ain't like that anymore ENDTOKEN
Hang me, watch awhile ENDTOKEN
Let me see you smile as I die ENDTOKEN
Take me, as my body burns ENDTOKEN
Let me see you yearn, while I cry ENDTOKEN
One step on your own ENDTOKEN
And you walk all over me ENDTOKEN
One head in the clouds ENDTOKEN
You won't let go, you're too proud ENDTOKEN
One light to the blind, and they see ENDTOKEN
One touch on the head, we believe ENDTOKEN
Adore me as I drift away ENDTOKEN
Let me hear you say I'm fine ENDTOKEN
You cry as my body dies ENDTOKEN
All that you despised is gone away ENDTOKEN
One step on your own ENDTOKEN
And you walk all over me ENDTOKEN
One head in the clouds ENDTOKEN
You won't let go, you're too proud ENDTOKEN
One light to the blind, and they see ENDTOKEN
One touch on the head, we believe ENDTOKEN

One step on your own ENDTOKEN
And you walk all over me ENDTOKEN
One head in the clouds ENDTOKEN

One light to the blind, and they see ENDTOKEN
One touch on the head, we believe ENDTOKEN
We believe, yeah ENDTOKEN
(We believe) ENDTOKEN
This time, this place ENDTOKEN
Misused, mistakes ENDTOKEN
Too long, too late ENDTOKEN

Just one chance, just one breath ENDTOKEN
Just in case there's just one left ENDTOKEN
'Cause you know ENDTOKEN
You know, you know ENDTOKEN
I love you ENDTOKEN
I loved you all along ENDTOKEN
And I miss you ENDTOKEN
Been far away for far too long ENDTOKEN
I keep dreaming you'll be with me ENDTOKEN

On my knees, I'll ask ENDTOKEN
Last chance for one last dance ENDTOKEN

All of Hell to hold your hand ENDTOKEN

Small town boy with a big town dream ENDTOKEN
Wants to fly, but he can't find wings ENDTOKEN
And they said he's only wasting time ENDTOKEN
You chase that dream too far, it's time for you to change ENDTOKEN
If it's alright by you, can I just stay the same? ENDTOKEN
'Cause everybody's got a right to change ENDTOKEN
I didn't say that I would ENDTOKEN
Sometimes you have to do your own thing ENDTOKEN
And I think that I should ENDTOKEN
Everybody's got a right to dream ENDTOKEN
I'm gonna be the one I wanted to be, yeah ENDTOKEN
You better believe it ENDTOKEN
Hey there boy, look at where you are ENDTOKEN
That guitar will never take you far ENDTOKEN
And they said he'd die without a dime ENDTOKEN
But his heart only beats to songs he longs to play ENDTOKEN
And his mouth only speaks the words he wants to say ENDTOKEN
'Cause everybody's got a right to change ENDTOKEN
I didn't say that I would ENDTOKEN
Sometimes you have to do your own thing ENDTOKEN
And I think that I should ENDTOKEN
Everybody's got a right to dream ENDTOKEN
I'm gonna be the one I wanted to be, yeah ENDTOKEN
You better believe it ENDTOKEN
Everybody's got a right to change ENDTOKEN
I didn't say that I would ENDTOKEN
Sometimes you have to do your own thing ENDTOKEN
And I think that I should ENDTOKEN
Everybody's got a right to dream ENDTOKEN
I'm gonna be the one I wanted to be, yeah ENDTOKEN
You better believe it ENDTOKEN
Everybody's got a right to change ENDTOKEN
I didn't say that I would ENDTOKEN
Sometimes you have to do your own thing ENDTOKEN
And I think that I should ENDTOKEN
Everybody's got a right to dream ENDTOKEN
I'm gonna be the one I wanted to be, yeah ENDTOKEN
You better believe it ENDTOKEN
I don't mind ENDTOKEN
Wasting time with you ENDTOKEN
Days go by, the man is fly ENDTOKEN
As long we've got nothing to do ENDTOKEN
I'll take my time ENDTOKEN
Stay in line for you ENDTOKEN
I won't go fast, I'll make this last ENDTOKEN
There's nothing that I won't go through ENDTOKEN
You gotta walk before you run ENDTOKEN
You gotta walk before you run ENDTOKEN
It's so hard to do ENDTOKEN
I'd give up forever just to be with you ENDTOKEN
I hope you know ENDTOKEN
I love you so, you see ENDTOKEN
You know no one knows just what we have ENDTOKEN
Because it's for you and for me ENDTOKEN
When I fall down ENDTOKEN
You're holding ground next to me ENDTOKEN
You're over the moon ENDTOKEN
You're under my skin ENDTOKEN
You're inside of me on the side looking in ENDTOKEN
You gotta walk before you run ENDTOKEN
You gotta walk before you run ENDTOKEN
It's so hard to do ENDTOKEN
I'd give up forever just to be with you ENDTOKEN
You gotta walk before you run ENDTOKEN
You gotta walk before you run ENDTOKEN
It's so hard to do ENDTOKEN
I'd give up forever just to be with you ENDTOKEN
I know a place where's nothing but time ENDTOKEN
And I think that's where we should go ENDTOKEN
Hand in hand in the sand, I hope we much stand ENDTOKEN
There's only one thing you need to know ENDTOKEN
You gotta walk before you run ENDTOKEN
You gotta walk before you run ENDTOKEN
It's so hard to do ENDTOKEN
I'd give up forever just to be with you ENDTOKEN
You gotta walk before you run ENDTOKEN
You gotta walk before you run ENDTOKEN
It's so hard to do ENDTOKEN
I'd give up forever just to be with you ENDTOKEN
I'd give up forever just to be with you ENDTOKEN
I'd give up forever just to be with you ENDTOKEN
You call to me, and I fall at your feet ENDTOKEN
How could anyone ask for more? ENDTOKEN
(How could anyone ask for more?) ENDTOKEN
And our time apart, like knives in my heart ENDTOKEN
How could anyone ask for more? ENDTOKEN
(How could anyone ask for more?) ENDTOKEN
But if there's a pill to help me forget ENDTOKEN
God knows I haven't found it yet ENDTOKEN
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to ENDTOKEN
'Cause trying not to love you, only goes so far ENDTOKEN
And trying not to need you, is tearing me apart ENDTOKEN
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor ENDTOKEN
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for ENDTOKEN
'Cause trying not to love you ENDTOKEN
Only makes me love you more ENDTOKEN
Only makes me love you more ENDTOKEN
And this kind of pain, only time takes away ENDTOKEN
That's why it's harder to let you go (That's why it's harder to let you go) ENDTOKEN
And nothing I can do, without thinking of you ENDTOKEN
That's why it's harder to let you go (That's why it's harder to let you go) ENDTOKEN
But if there's a pill to help me forget ENDTOKEN
God knows I haven't found it yet ENDTOKEN
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to ENDTOKEN
'Cause trying not to love you, only goes so far ENDTOKEN
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart ENDTOKEN
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor ENDTOKEN
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for ENDTOKEN
'Cause trying not to love you ENDTOKEN
Only makes me love you more ENDTOKEN
So I sit here divided, just talking to myself ENDTOKEN
Was it something that I did? Was there somebody else? ENDTOKEN
When a voice from behind me, that was fighting back tears ENDTOKEN
Sat right down beside me, whispered right in my ear ENDTOKEN
Said, I've been dying to tell you ENDTOKEN
Trying not to love you, only went so far ENDTOKEN
Trying not to need you, was tearing me apart ENDTOKEN
Now I see the silver lining, from what we're fighting for ENDTOKEN
We just keep on trying, we could be much more ENDTOKEN
'Cause trying not to love you ENDTOKEN
Oh, yeah, trying not to love you ENDTOKEN
Only makes me love you more ENDTOKEN
Only makes me love you more ENDTOKEN
Bribing me, we come, we watched how ENDTOKEN
We're last to throw our pennies ENDTOKEN
A passive tramps lifts her skirt ENDTOKEN
And asks us then we throw them down to her ENDTOKEN
And I know why I will always follow you ENDTOKEN
Anywhere my brother leads me to ENDTOKEN
We don't want to live in the sun ENDTOKEN
Just to keep them happy for a while ENDTOKEN
Midnight, and Frank freaks out and reaches God and ENDTOKEN
Fairly tied up too ENDTOKEN
But I know why I will always follow you ENDTOKEN
Anywhere my brother leads me to ENDTOKEN
And I remember wanting to be you ENDTOKEN
And pray to God that we would all pull through ENDTOKEN
'Cause I know why I will always follow you ENDTOKEN
If you're my brother, then I will follow you ENDTOKEN
Lifelong friends threw bottle ends ENDTOKEN
And yell in the air like lifelong enemies ENDTOKEN
Who's stronger, who's lived longer? ENDTOKEN
World quarrels and grand kids on your knee ENDTOKEN
'Cause I know I will always follow ENDTOKEN
Anywhere my brother leads me to ENDTOKEN
And I remember wanting to be you ENDTOKEN
And pray to God that we would all pull through ENDTOKEN
Cause I know why I will always follow you ENDTOKEN
If you're my brother, then I will follow you ENDTOKEN
'Cause I know why I will always follow ENDTOKEN
I will follow you and I will ENDTOKEN
I know why I will always follow ENDTOKEN
I will follow you and I will ENDTOKEN
You're not what I need anymore ENDTOKEN
Forget those games you're playin' ENDTOKEN
You're not what I need anymore ENDTOKEN
I can't hear what you're saying ENDTOKEN
If you won't listen to me ENDTOKEN
How can you tell me how I feel? ENDTOKEN
All along I told you ENDTOKEN
That I cannot feel the pain ENDTOKEN
Who are you to tell me ENDTOKEN
I'm not good enough? ENDTOKEN
All I've ever wanted was a place ENDTOKEN
Inside of you ENDTOKEN
Why should I hear what you say any longer? ENDTOKEN
When you don't even know where I've been ENDTOKEN
I feel something in me getting stronger ENDTOKEN
And I won't get kicked around again ENDTOKEN
If you won't listen to me ENDTOKEN
How can you tell me how I feel? ENDTOKEN
All along I told you ENDTOKEN
That I cannot feel the pain ENDTOKEN
Who are you to tell me ENDTOKEN
I'm not good enough? ENDTOKEN

Who are you to tell me ENDTOKEN
I'm not good enough? ENDTOKEN
All I've ever wanted was a place ENDTOKEN
Inside of you ENDTOKEN
You're not what I need anymore ENDTOKEN
Have I gone all too far? ENDTOKEN
Have I been here before? ENDTOKEN
If I have, let me know ENDTOKEN
How it goes ENDTOKEN
Take her place ENDTOKEN
And I will ENDTOKEN
See her face ENDTOKEN
No reason ENDTOKEN
Let it slide ENDTOKEN
And I will ENDTOKEN
Watch her die ENDTOKEN
To run through fields ENDTOKEN
To find, and I will ENDTOKEN
Hold, then lead, then lie ENDTOKEN
And I will, no I won't ENDTOKEN
Is it now really time? ENDTOKEN
Can I just give mine? ENDTOKEN
If I can simply trade ENDTOKEN
Deal made ENDTOKEN
Take her place ENDTOKEN
And I will ENDTOKEN
See her face ENDTOKEN
No reason ENDTOKEN
Let it slide ENDTOKEN
And I will ENDTOKEN
Watch her die ENDTOKEN
To run through fields ENDTOKEN
To find, and I will ENDTOKEN
Hold, then lead, then lie ENDTOKEN
And I will, no I won't ENDTOKEN
Run, hide away from me ENDTOKEN
Desouled, to seek, decide ENDTOKEN
And I will, no I won't ENDTOKEN
Run through fields to find ENDTOKEN
Hold then lead, then lie ENDTOKEN
And I will ENDTOKEN
Away from me ENDTOKEN
Run, desouled, and ENDTOKEN
Hold, to heal, to find ENDTOKEN
And I can't ENDTOKEN
Run through fields to find ENDTOKEN
Hold then lead, then lie ENDTOKEN
And I will ENDTOKEN
Away from me ENDTOKEN
Run, desouled, and ENDTOKEN
Hold, to heal, to find ENDTOKEN
No I won't ENDTOKEN
Forever's a lonely time and the dogs aren't always ENDTOKEN
Aren't always on my mind ENDTOKEN
'Cause I didn't free them ENDTOKEN
The scenery is burning me 'cause I'm still in it ENDTOKEN
So why don't you free me ENDTOKEN
'Cause its not my business ENDTOKEN
What he's done to me ENDTOKEN
Control is all you really need ENDTOKEN
And I can't believe it ENDTOKEN
I can't believe that ENDTOKEN
You didn't see me ENDTOKEN
Passing glances fall on me ENDTOKEN
Like screams on deaf ears ENDTOKEN
They're all laughing at me ENDTOKEN
With encouraging cheers ENDTOKEN
What he's done to me ENDTOKEN
Control is all you really need ENDTOKEN
And I can't believe it ENDTOKEN
I can't believe that ENDTOKEN
You wouldn't free me ENDTOKEN
Why don't you see me? ENDTOKEN
Why don't you free me? ENDTOKEN
I can't believe that ENDTOKEN
You don't believe me ENDTOKEN
I guess I had it comin' ENDTOKEN
My fault for not runnin' ENDTOKEN
I just dressed too tempting ENDTOKEN
'Cause your heads fuckin empty ENDTOKEN
And I can't believe it ENDTOKEN
I can't believe that you didn't see me ENDTOKEN
She came calling one early morning ENDTOKEN
She showed her crown of thorns ENDTOKEN
She whispered softly to tell a story ENDTOKEN
About how she had been wronged ENDTOKEN
As she lay lifeless ENDTOKEN
He stole her innocence ENDTOKEN
And this is how she carried on ENDTOKEN
This is how she carried on ENDTOKEN
Well, I guess she closed her eyes ENDTOKEN
And just imagined everything's alright ENDTOKEN
But she could not hide her tears ENDTOKEN
Because they were sent to wash away those years ENDTOKEN
They were sent to wash away those years ENDTOKEN
My anger's violent but still I'm silent ENDTOKEN
When tragedy strikes at home ENDTOKEN
I know this decadence is shared by millions ENDTOKEN
Remember you're not alone[x2] ENDTOKEN
Well, if you just close your eyes ENDTOKEN
And just imagine everything's alright ENDTOKEN
But do not hide your tears ENDTOKEN
Because they were sent to wash away those years ENDTOKEN
Well, if you just close your eyes ENDTOKEN
And just imagine everything's alright ENDTOKEN
But do not hide your tears ENDTOKEN
Because they were sent to wash away those years ENDTOKEN
They were sent to wash away those years ENDTOKEN
Maybe, we can wash away those years ENDTOKEN
For we have crossed many oceans ENDTOKEN
And we labor in between ENDTOKEN
In life there are many quotients ENDTOKEN
And I hope I find the mean ENDTOKEN
The mean, the mean ENDTOKEN
Well, if you just close your eyes ENDTOKEN
And just imagine everything's alright ENDTOKEN
But do not hide your tears ENDTOKEN
Because they were sent to wash away those years ENDTOKEN
Well, if you just close your eyes ENDTOKEN
And just imagine everything's alright ENDTOKEN
But do not hide your tears ENDTOKEN
Because they were sent to wash away those years ENDTOKEN
Maybe, we can wash away those years ENDTOKEN
I hope that you can wash away those years ENDTOKEN
This time, I wonder what it feels like ENDTOKEN
To find the one in this life ENDTOKEN
The one we all dream of ENDTOKEN
But dreams just aren't enough ENDTOKEN
So I'll be waiting for the real thing ENDTOKEN
I'll know it by the feeling ENDTOKEN
The moment when we're meeting ENDTOKEN
Will play out like a scene ENDTOKEN
Straight off the silver screen ENDTOKEN
So I'll be holding my breath ENDTOKEN
Right up 'til the end ENDTOKEN
Until that moment when ENDTOKEN
I find the one that I'll spend forever with ENDTOKEN
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there ENDTOKEN
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares ENDTOKEN
Someone to love with my life in their hands ENDTOKEN
There's gotta be somebody for me like that ENDTOKEN
'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own) ENDTOKEN
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone) ENDTOKEN
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere) ENDTOKEN
There's gotta be somebody for me out there ENDTOKEN
Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight ENDTOKEN
And dammit, this feels too right ENDTOKEN
It's just like déja vu, me standing here with you ENDTOKEN
So I'll be holding my breath ENDTOKEN
Could this be the end? ENDTOKEN
Is it that moment when ENDTOKEN
I find the one that I'll spend forever with? ENDTOKEN
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there ENDTOKEN
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares ENDTOKEN
Someone to love with my life in their hands ENDTOKEN
There's gotta be somebody for me like that ENDTOKEN
'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own) ENDTOKEN
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone) ENDTOKEN
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere) ENDTOKEN
There's gotta be somebody for me out there ENDTOKEN
Ooh, you can't give up (When you're looking for) ENDTOKEN
A diamond in the rough ('Cause you never know) ENDTOKEN
When it shows up (Make sure you're holding on) ENDTOKEN
'Cause it could be the one ENDTOKEN
The one you're waiting on ENDTOKEN
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there ENDTOKEN
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares ENDTOKEN
Someone to love with my life in their hands ENDTOKEN
There's gotta be somebody for me, oh ENDTOKEN
Nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own) ENDTOKEN
And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone) ENDTOKEN
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere) ENDTOKEN
There's gotta be somebody for me out there ENDTOKEN
Nobody wants to be the last one there (When you're looking for) ENDTOKEN
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares ('Cause you never know) ENDTOKEN
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (Make sure you're holding on) ENDTOKEN
There's gotta be somebody for me out there ENDTOKEN
Just one more moment, that's all that's needed ENDTOKEN
Like wounded soldiers in need of healing ENDTOKEN
Time to be honest, this time I'm pleading ENDTOKEN
Please don't dwell on it, 'cause I didn't mean it ENDTOKEN
I can’t believe I said I'd lay our love on the ground ENDTOKEN
But it doesn't matter 'cause I've made it up, forgive me now ENDTOKEN
Every day I spend away, my soul's inside out ENDTOKEN
Gotta be some way that I can make it up to you now, somehow ENDTOKEN
By now you'd know that I'd come for you ENDTOKEN
No one but you, yes, I'd come for you ENDTOKEN
But only if you told me to ENDTOKEN
And I'd fight for you ENDTOKEN
I'd lie, it's true ENDTOKEN
Give my life for you ENDTOKEN
You know I'd always come for you ENDTOKEN
I was blindfolded, but now I'm seeing ENDTOKEN
My mind was closing, now I'm believing ENDTOKEN
I finally know just what it means to let someone in ENDTOKEN
To see the side of me that no one does or ever will ENDTOKEN
So if you're ever lost and find yourself all alone ENDTOKEN
I'd search forever just to bring you home ENDTOKEN
Here and now, this I vow ENDTOKEN
By now you'd know that I'd come for you ENDTOKEN
No one but you, yes, I'd come for you ENDTOKEN
But only if you told me to ENDTOKEN
And I'd fight for you ENDTOKEN
I'd lie, it's true ENDTOKEN
Give my life for you ENDTOKEN
You know I'd always come for you ENDTOKEN
You know I'd always come for you ENDTOKEN
No matter what gets in my way ENDTOKEN
As long as there's still life in me ENDTOKEN
No matter what, remember you know I'll always come for you ENDTOKEN
Yes, I'd come for you, no one but you ENDTOKEN
Yes, I'd come for you ENDTOKEN
But only if you told me to ENDTOKEN
And I'd fight for you ENDTOKEN
I'd lie, it's true ENDTOKEN
Give my life for you ENDTOKEN
You know I'd always come for you ENDTOKEN
No matter what gets in my way ENDTOKEN
As long as there's still life in me ENDTOKEN
No matter what, remember you know I'll always come for you ENDTOKEN
I'd crawl across this world for you ENDTOKEN
Do anything you want me to ENDTOKEN
No matter what, remember you know I'll always come for you ENDTOKEN
You know I'll always come for you ENDTOKEN
There were never any right words to say ENDTOKEN
Somehow those words will never come ENDTOKEN
Even when I thought it all out ENDTOKEN
No matter what I said or done ENDTOKEN
And I kept getting in my own way ENDTOKEN
Always looking for number one ENDTOKEN
I felt like I was lost in the crowd ENDTOKEN
But I can hear you calling my name ENDTOKEN
That’s where your love found me there ENDTOKEN
Lost and alone and headed nowhere ENDTOKEN
That’s where your love found me there ENDTOKEN
Maybe you didn’t know ENDTOKEN
You whispered the words that I needed ENDTOKEN
And maybe I didn’t show ENDTOKEN
When my broken heart was afraid ENDTOKEN
But there was nowhere that I could run ENDTOKEN
And when all of my dreams had conceded ENDTOKEN
And they ran away ENDTOKEN
You gave me more than I could explain ENDTOKEN
And I can hear you calling my name ENDTOKEN
That’s where your love found me there ENDTOKEN
Lost and alone and headed nowhere ENDTOKEN
That’s where your love found me there ENDTOKEN
Falling apart and no one was there ENDTOKEN
That’s where your love found me there ENDTOKEN
Killing myself and I didn’t care ENDTOKEN
That’s where your love found me there ENDTOKEN
Whoa, oh ENDTOKEN
Whoa, oh ENDTOKEN
Whoa, oh ENDTOKEN
Whoa, oh ENDTOKEN
That’s where your love found me there ENDTOKEN
Lost and alone and headed nowhere ENDTOKEN
That’s where your love found me there ENDTOKEN
Falling apart and no one was there ENDTOKEN
That’s where your love found me there ENDTOKEN
Killing myself and I didn’t care ENDTOKEN
That’s where your love found me there ENDTOKEN
How do you know where you're going ENDTOKEN
When you don't know where you've been? ENDTOKEN
You hide the shame that you're not showing ENDTOKEN
And you won't let anyone in ENDTOKEN
A crowded street can be a quiet place ENDTOKEN
When you're walking alone ENDTOKEN
And now you think that you're the only ENDTOKEN
One who doesn't ENDTOKEN
Have to try ENDTOKEN
And you won't have to fail ENDTOKEN
If you're afraid to fly ENDTOKEN
Then I guess you never will ENDTOKEN
You hide behind your walls ENDTOKEN
Of maybe nevers ENDTOKEN
Forgetting that there's something more ENDTOKEN
Than just knowing better ENDTOKEN
Your mistakes do not define you now ENDTOKEN
They tell you who you're not ENDTOKEN
You've got to live this life you're given ENDTOKEN
Like it's the only one you've got ENDTOKEN
Memories have left you broken ENDTOKEN
And the scars have never healed ENDTOKEN
The emptiness in you is growing ENDTOKEN
But so little left to fill ENDTOKEN
You're scared to look back on the days before ENDTOKEN
You're too tired to move on ENDTOKEN
And now you think that you're the only one who doesn't ENDTOKEN
Have to try ENDTOKEN
And you won't have to fail ENDTOKEN
If you're afraid to fly ENDTOKEN
Then I guess you never will ENDTOKEN
You hide behind your walls ENDTOKEN
Of maybe nevers ENDTOKEN
Forgetting that there's something more ENDTOKEN
Than just knowing better ENDTOKEN
Your mistakes do not define you now ENDTOKEN
They tell you who you're not ENDTOKEN
You've got to live this life you're given ENDTOKEN
Like it's the only one you've got ENDTOKEN
What would it take ENDTOKEN
To get you to say that I'll try ENDTOKEN
And what would you say if ENDTOKEN
This was the last day of your life ENDTOKEN
You hide behind your walls ENDTOKEN
Of maybe never's ENDTOKEN
Forgetting that there's something more ENDTOKEN
Than just knowing better ENDTOKEN
Your mistakes do not define you now ENDTOKEN
They tell you who you're not ENDTOKEN
You've got to live this life you're given ENDTOKEN
Like it's the only one you've got ENDTOKEN
You hide behind your walls ENDTOKEN
Of maybe nevers ENDTOKEN
Forgetting that there's something more ENDTOKEN
Than just knowing better ENDTOKEN
Your mistakes do not define you now ENDTOKEN
They tell you who you're not ENDTOKEN
You've got to live this life you're given ENDTOKEN
Like it's the only one you've got ENDTOKEN
Don’t cry victim to me ENDTOKEN
Everything we are and used to be ENDTOKEN
Is buried and gone ENDTOKEN
Now it’s my turn to speak ENDTOKEN
It’s my turn to expose and ENDTOKEN
Release what’s been killing me ENDTOKEN
I’ll be damned fighting you ENDTOKEN
It’s impossible, impossible ENDTOKEN
Say goodbye, with no sympathy ENDTOKEN
I’m entitled to overcome ENDTOKEN
Completely stunned and numb ENDTOKEN
Knock me down, throw me to the floor ENDTOKEN
There’s no pain I can feel no more ENDTOKEN
I’m entitled to overcome ENDTOKEN
Overcome ENDTOKEN
Finally see what’s beneath ENDTOKEN
Everything I am and hope to be ENDTOKEN
Cannot be lost ENDTOKEN
I’ll be damned fighting you ENDTOKEN
You’re impossible, impossible ENDTOKEN
Say goodbye, with no sympathy ENDTOKEN
I’m entitled to overcome ENDTOKEN
Completely stunned and numb ENDTOKEN
Knock me down, throw me to the floor ENDTOKEN
There’s no pain I can feel no more ENDTOKEN
I’m entitled to overcome ENDTOKEN
Overcome ENDTOKEN
Overcome ENDTOKEN
You’ll never know what I was thinking before you came around ENDTOKEN
Take a step, take a breath, put your guard down ENDTOKEN
I cannot worry anymore of what you think of me ENDTOKEN
I may be crazy but I'm buried in your memory ENDTOKEN
I’m entitled to overcome ENDTOKEN
Completely stunned and numb ENDTOKEN
Knock me down, throw me to the floor ENDTOKEN
There’s no pain I can feel no more ENDTOKEN
I’m entitled to overcome ENDTOKEN
Completely stunned and numb ENDTOKEN
I’m entitled to overcome ENDTOKEN
Completely stunned and numb ENDTOKEN
I’m entitled to overcome ENDTOKEN
I may be crazy but I'm buried in your memory ENDTOKEN
I went out on the town with a friend last weekend ENDTOKEN
His ex-girlfriend's friend was there alone ENDTOKEN
She bought a couple rounds and I got the feeling ENDTOKEN
She could really handle alcohol ENDTOKEN
Another one down and headed off the deep end ENDTOKEN
The more we drank, the less that we had on ENDTOKEN
And it turns out she's got everything I want, all rolled into one ENDTOKEN
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo ENDTOKEN
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt ENDTOKEN
She's got a fast car, hotter than a dance bar ENDTOKEN
Looking like a rock star, she'll be the talk of the town ENDTOKEN
You know, she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one ENDTOKEN
Gotta get me some ENDTOKEN
God almighty, look at that body ENDTOKEN
Flickers like a sticker on a new Ferrari ENDTOKEN
She's a scene from a Baywatch rerun ENDTOKEN
Hotter than a barrel on a squeezed machine gun ENDTOKEN
Well, she can get lower than a Maserati ENDTOKEN
Never seen somebody move that way ENDTOKEN
Everywhere she goes there's an instant party ENDTOKEN
Everybody wants to know her name ENDTOKEN
And it turns out she's got everything I want, all rolled into one ENDTOKEN
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo ENDTOKEN
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt ENDTOKEN
She's got a fast car, hotter than a dance bar ENDTOKEN
Looking like a rock star, and she likes to go out and ENDTOKEN
Get her hands on ENDTOKEN
Anything to stand on ENDTOKEN
Anything to dance on ENDTOKEN
And she'd be swinging around ENDTOKEN
Under the hot lights, underneath the spotlight ENDTOKEN
Even going all night ENDTOKEN
She'll be the talk of the town, you know ENDTOKEN
She's got everything I want, but all rolled into one ENDTOKEN
Gotta get me some ENDTOKEN
God almighty, look at that body ENDTOKEN
Flickers like a sticker on a new Ferrari ENDTOKEN
She's a scene from a Baywatch rerun ENDTOKEN
Hotter than a barrel on a squeezed machine gun ENDTOKEN
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo ENDTOKEN
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt ENDTOKEN
She's got a fast car, hotter than a dance bar ENDTOKEN

Under the hot lights, underneath the spotlight ENDTOKEN
Even going all night ENDTOKEN
She'll be the talk of the town, you know ENDTOKEN
She's got everything I want, but all rolled into one ENDTOKEN
Gotta get me some ENDTOKEN
I gotta get me some ENDTOKEN
Gotta get me some ENDTOKEN
Please don't be too long while you're gone ENDTOKEN
There ain't enough to keep me here too long ENDTOKEN
Not like the last time I stood in line ENDTOKEN
Just enough to keep me bouncing off the walls, yeah ENDTOKEN
The new day, the new tray that comes around ENDTOKEN
Pills and all, enough to kill him while he sleeps ENDTOKEN
Is this the alley we drag him to? ENDTOKEN
Just off of Hollywood and Normandy ENDTOKEN
If it worked like she said it would ENDTOKEN
Just like living in Hollywood ENDTOKEN
Just like a bad dream, or so it seems ENDTOKEN
Just like I'm back in emergency ENDTOKEN
If it worked like she said it would ENDTOKEN
Just like living in Hollywood ENDTOKEN
Just like a bad dream, or so it seems ENDTOKEN
Just like I'm back in emergency ENDTOKEN
Please don't be too long while you're gone ENDTOKEN
There ain't enough to keep me here too long ENDTOKEN
Not like the last time I stood in line ENDTOKEN
Just enough to keep me bouncing off the walls ENDTOKEN
If it worked like she said it would ENDTOKEN
Just like living in Hollywood ENDTOKEN
Just like a bad dream, or so it seems ENDTOKEN
Just like I'm back in emergency ENDTOKEN
If it worked like she said it would ENDTOKEN
Just like living in Hollywood ENDTOKEN
Just like a bad dream, or so it seems ENDTOKEN
Just like I'm back in emergency ENDTOKEN
Woke up and had a face to face ENDTOKEN
Guess my reflection had a lot to say ENDTOKEN
Why let my worries steal my days ENDTOKEN
It just brings me down ENDTOKEN
Does the song you sing ENDTOKEN
Have enough meaning ENDTOKEN
Inspire us to sing along ENDTOKEN
Does the song you sing ENDTOKEN
Keep echoing ENDTOKEN
Inspire us to sing the song you sing ENDTOKEN
What's wrong with the world today ENDTOKEN
Tell me what's all the talk about ENDTOKEN
Lately I've been in a real bad place ENDTOKEN
Can't let the world bring me down ENDTOKEN
I hope (I hope) ENDTOKEN
The words I wrote (the words I wrote) ENDTOKEN
Keep calling out (keep calling out) ENDTOKEN
Keep calling out (keep calling out) ENDTOKEN
Forever (forever) let them sing (let them sing) ENDTOKEN
That song you sing, that song you sing ENDTOKEN
The song you sing the song you sing ENDTOKEN
It's the song you sing, it's the life you bring ENDTOKEN
It's why I sing the song you sing ENDTOKEN
(This is the call to the broken, the broken) ENDTOKEN
Take it from me ENDTOKEN
They don't care if you're lonely ENDTOKEN
As you can see ENDTOKEN
They don't care if you're scared ENDTOKEN
Your heart is the only friend you have in this whole world ENDTOKEN
Don't start, think you can't do this yourself ENDTOKEN
This is the call out ENDTOKEN
This is the call to the broken (stand up) ENDTOKEN
To all the ones who've been thrown away ENDTOKEN
This is the call to the broken (stand up) ENDTOKEN
Stand up and take back your world today ENDTOKEN
(Stand up) ENDTOKEN
I know what you're thinking ENDTOKEN
You say you're tired of keeping score, keeping score ENDTOKEN
Trust me, you're not the only one going through this ENDTOKEN
You see, I've been through this before, this before ENDTOKEN
This is the call to the broken (stand up) ENDTOKEN
To all the ones who've been thrown away ENDTOKEN
This is the call to the broken (stand up) ENDTOKEN
Stand up and take back your world today ENDTOKEN
This is the call to the broken (stand up) ENDTOKEN
We're gonna do this our own way ENDTOKEN
This is the call to the broken (stand up) ENDTOKEN
Stand up and take back your world today ENDTOKEN
They found their strength in a weakness ENDTOKEN
To keep us there when we fall down ENDTOKEN
But now we hold all pieces ENDTOKEN
To change the world this is the call out ENDTOKEN
This is the call to the broken (stand up) ENDTOKEN
To all the ones who've been thrown away ENDTOKEN
This is the call to the broken (stand up) ENDTOKEN
Stand up and take back your world today ENDTOKEN
This is the call to the broken (stand up) ENDTOKEN
We're gonna do this our own way ENDTOKEN
This is the call to the broken (stand up) ENDTOKEN
Stand up and take back your world today ENDTOKEN
Tell your friends not to think aloud ENDTOKEN
Until they swallow ENDTOKEN
Whisper things into my brain ENDTOKEN
Your voice sounds so hollow ENDTOKEN
I am not a leader of men ENDTOKEN
Since I prefer to follow ENDTOKEN
Do you think I could have a drink ENDTOKEN
Since it's so hard to swallow? ENDTOKEN
So hard to swallow ENDTOKEN
So turn the television off ENDTOKEN
And I will sing a song ENDTOKEN
And if you suddenly have the urge ENDTOKEN
You can sing along ENDTOKEN
I touch your hand, I touch your face ENDTOKEN
I think the fruit is rotten ENDTOKEN
Give me lessons on how to breathe ENDTOKEN
Because I think I've forgotten ENDTOKEN
I think I've forgotten ENDTOKEN
One day, out to a cliff ENDTOKEN
That overlooks the water ENDTOKEN
I jumped in to save a girl ENDTOKEN
It was somebody's daughter ENDTOKEN
And now the ring that's on my hand ENDTOKEN
It was given to me by her ENDTOKEN
And to this day we all sit around ENDTOKEN
And dream of ways to get higher ENDTOKEN
To get much higher ENDTOKEN
Tell your friends not to think aloud ENDTOKEN
Until they swallow ENDTOKEN
Whisper things into my brain ENDTOKEN
Your voice sounds so hollow ENDTOKEN
I am not a leader of men ENDTOKEN
Since I prefer to follow ENDTOKEN
Do you think I could have a drink ENDTOKEN
Since it's so hard to swallow? ENDTOKEN
So hard to swallow ENDTOKEN
Standing humble, a fist of rage ENDTOKEN
A silent army, they call my name ENDTOKEN
See that firmly, and not in dismayed ENDTOKEN
I'm never broken, and I'm not afraid ENDTOKEN
So come with me, let's take this world and make a change ENDTOKEN
And we'll give this, more than we can take away ENDTOKEN
And we'll see this, through eyes we always thought were blind ENDTOKEN
If we could find, just one light to shine ENDTOKEN
Just one light to shine ENDTOKEN
Walls will crumble at our feet ENDTOKEN
All we know we will finally see ENDTOKEN
We'll fight for hope, and we'll kill this doubt ENDTOKEN
Angels of war, let me out ENDTOKEN
So come with me, (Come on!) let's take this word and make a change ENDTOKEN
We'll give this, more than we can take away ENDTOKEN
And we'll see this, through eyes we always thought were blind ENDTOKEN
If we could find, just one light to shine ENDTOKEN
Just one light to shine ENDTOKEN
Got to meet the hottie with the million dollar body ENDTOKEN
They say it’s over budget, but you'd pay her just to touch it, come on ENDTOKEN
Needs to hit the big screen and shoot a little love scene ENDTOKEN
If Hollywood had called her, she'd be gone before you hollered, come on ENDTOKEN
Dirty little lady with the pretty pink thong ENDTOKEN
Every sugar daddy hitting on her all night long ENDTOKEN
Doesn't care about the money, she could be with anybody ENDTOKEN
Ain't it funny how the honey wanted you all along ENDTOKEN
(You naughty thing) ENDTOKEN
You’re ripping up the dance floor, honey ENDTOKEN
(You naughty woman) ENDTOKEN
You shake your ass around for everyone ENDTOKEN
(You’re such a mover) ENDTOKEN
I love the way you dance with anybody ENDTOKEN
(The way you swing) ENDTOKEN
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb ENDTOKEN
You’re so much cooler when you never pull it out ENDTOKEN
'Cause you look so much cuter with something in your mouth ENDTOKEN
Crafty little lip tricks ENDTOKEN
Tattoos on her left hip ENDTOKEN
She bending as you’re spending ENDTOKEN
There’s no end to it, so baby, come on ENDTOKEN
Dressed up like a princess ENDTOKEN
Betting that her skin smells better ENDTOKEN
Than the scent of every flower in the desert, come on ENDTOKEN
Dirty little lady with the pretty pink thong ENDTOKEN
Every sugar daddy hitting on her all night long ENDTOKEN
Doesn't care about the money, she could be with anybody ENDTOKEN
Ain't it funny how the honey wanted you all along ENDTOKEN
(You naughty thing) ENDTOKEN
You’re ripping up the dance floor, honey ENDTOKEN
(You naughty woman) ENDTOKEN
You shake your ass around for everyone ENDTOKEN
(You’re such a mover) ENDTOKEN
I love the way you dance with anybody ENDTOKEN
(The way you swing) ENDTOKEN
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb ENDTOKEN
You’re so much cooler when you never pull it out ENDTOKEN
'Cause you look so much cuter with something in your mouth ENDTOKEN
She loves the night scene bar queen ENDTOKEN
Living for the fun taking over every dance floor like she's the only one ENDTOKEN
In the spotlight all night dissing everyone ENDTOKEN
And trying to look so innocent while sucking on her thumb ENDTOKEN
(You’re so much cooler) When you never pull it out ENDTOKEN
(So much cuter) With something in your mouth ENDTOKEN
(You naughty thing) ENDTOKEN
You’re ripping up the dance floor, honey ENDTOKEN
(You naughty woman) ENDTOKEN
You shake your ass around for everyone ENDTOKEN
I love the way you dance with anybody ENDTOKEN
(The way you swing) ENDTOKEN
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb ENDTOKEN
(You naughty thing) ENDTOKEN
You’re ripping up the dance floor, honey ENDTOKEN
(You naughty woman) ENDTOKEN
You shake that ass around for everyone ENDTOKEN
(You’re such a mover) ENDTOKEN
I love the way you dance with anybody ENDTOKEN
(The way you swing) ENDTOKEN
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb ENDTOKEN
You’re so much cooler when you never pull it out ENDTOKEN
'Cause you look so much cuter with something in your... ENDTOKEN
One more depending on a prayer ENDTOKEN
And we all look away ENDTOKEN
People pretending everywhere ENDTOKEN
It's just another day ENDTOKEN
There's bullets flying through the air ENDTOKEN
And they still carry on ENDTOKEN
We watch it happen over there ENDTOKEN
And then just turn it off ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
We must stand together ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
There's no giving in ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
Hand in hand forever ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
That's when we all win ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
That's, that's, that's when we all win ENDTOKEN
That's, that's, that's when we all win ENDTOKEN
They tell us everything's alright ENDTOKEN
And we just go along ENDTOKEN
How can we fall asleep at night ENDTOKEN
When something's clearly wrong? ENDTOKEN
When we could feed a starving world ENDTOKEN
With what we throw away ENDTOKEN
But all we serve are empty words ENDTOKEN
That always taste the same ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
We must stand together ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
There's no giving in ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
Hand in hand forever ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
That's when we all win ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
That's, that's, that's when we all win ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
That's, that's, that's when we all win ENDTOKEN
The right thing to guide us ENDTOKEN
Is right here inside us ENDTOKEN
No one can divide us ENDTOKEN
When the light is nearly gone ENDTOKEN
But just like a heartbeat ENDTOKEN
The drumbeat carries on ENDTOKEN
And the drumbeat carries on ENDTOKEN
Just like a heartbeat ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
We must stand together ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
There's no giving in ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
Hand in hand forever ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
That's when we all win ENDTOKEN
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah ENDTOKEN
That's, that's, that's when we all win ENDTOKEN
That's, that's, that's when we all win ENDTOKEN
I can taste the color of the lights ENDTOKEN
Take one of those and two of these ENDTOKEN
Then watch the walls begin to breathe ENDTOKEN
I can taste the color of the lights ENDTOKEN
Wings are growing out of me ENDTOKEN
The floor is floating underneath ENDTOKEN
I can see the future burning bright ENDTOKEN
Future burning bright ENDTOKEN
The ceiling has us mesmerized ENDTOKEN
It feels like we could never die ENDTOKEN
Heading for the dark side of the moon ENDTOKEN
As we lift off into the sky ENDTOKEN
Invincible and so alive ENDTOKEN
Ten feet tall and fucking bulletproof ENDTOKEN
Insanity is setting in ENDTOKEN
Reality is getting thin ENDTOKEN
The universe just started slowing down ENDTOKEN
Yet suddenly we're traveling ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
We're going a million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
When shadows soon start breaking free ENDTOKEN
No longer held by gravity ENDTOKEN
(How did we get so far from the ground?) ENDTOKEN
Speaking to the galaxy ENDTOKEN
Received and sending back to me ENDTOKEN
I can finally hear the speed of sound ENDTOKEN
Speed of fucking sound ENDTOKEN
I like this everlasting pill ENDTOKEN
'Cause time itself is standing still ENDTOKEN
Why's the room still spinning just the same? ENDTOKEN
Turn off your phone so no one calls ENDTOKEN
'Cause you and I are tripping balls ENDTOKEN
I can still hear ringing in my brain ENDTOKEN
Insanity is setting in ENDTOKEN
Reality is getting thin ENDTOKEN
See no signs of ever coming down ENDTOKEN
Yet suddenly we're traveling ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
We're going a million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
Insanity is setting in ENDTOKEN
Reality is getting thin ENDTOKEN
The particles are dancing all around ENDTOKEN
I can't deny the hardest thing for me ENDTOKEN
Is finding time to finally breathe ENDTOKEN
See no signs of ever coming down ENDTOKEN
Another wave is coming in ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
We're going a million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
A million miles an hour ENDTOKEN
Always waiting for something ENDTOKEN
Searching for one thing ENDTOKEN
And I know it has to be there somewhere ENDTOKEN
All this room without knowing ENDTOKEN
The way this is going ENDTOKEN
As long as it takes me anywhere ENDTOKEN
There's life and there's one dance ENDTOKEN
There's fate and there's one chance ENDTOKEN
To find out who I want to be ENDTOKEN
And I know it's inside of me ENDTOKEN
I look to the far side ENDTOKEN
Searching for daylight ENDTOKEN
Something that is mine, all my own ENDTOKEN
And loving in hindsight ENDTOKEN
That won't work for my life ENDTOKEN
Let me forget all that went wrong ENDTOKEN
There's life and there's one dance ENDTOKEN
There's fate and there's one chance ENDTOKEN
To find out who I want to be ENDTOKEN
And I know it's inside of me ENDTOKEN
There's love in so much more ENDTOKEN
That waits behind that door ENDTOKEN
There's so much that I want to see ENDTOKEN
And I know it's inside of me ENDTOKEN
Oh, woah, woah ENDTOKEN
Oh, woah, woah, woah ENDTOKEN
There's life and there's one dance ENDTOKEN
There's fate and there's one chance ENDTOKEN
To find out who I want to be ENDTOKEN
And I know it's inside of me ENDTOKEN
There's love in so much more ENDTOKEN
That waits behind that door ENDTOKEN
There's so much that I want to see ENDTOKEN
And I know it's inside of me ENDTOKEN
It's inside of me ENDTOKEN
Oh, it's inside of me ENDTOKEN
Oh, woah ENDTOKEN
Run, hide, all that was sacred to us ENDTOKEN
Sacred to us, see the signs ENDTOKEN
The covenant has been broken by mankind ENDTOKEN
Leaving us with no shoulder, with no shoulder ENDTOKEN
To rest our head on ENDTOKEN
To rest our head on ENDTOKEN
To rest our head on ENDTOKEN
Who's got my back now ENDTOKEN
When all we have left is deceptive? ENDTOKEN
So disconnected ENDTOKEN
What is the truth now? ENDTOKEN
(What is the truth now?) ENDTOKEN
There's still time, all that has been devastated ENDTOKEN
Can be recreated, realize ENDTOKEN
We pick up the broken pieces of our lives ENDTOKEN
Giving ourselves to each other, ourselves to each other ENDTOKEN
To rest our head on ENDTOKEN
To rest our head on ENDTOKEN
To rest our head on ENDTOKEN
Who's got my back now ENDTOKEN
When all we have left is deceptive? ENDTOKEN
So disconnected ENDTOKEN
What is the truth now? ENDTOKEN
Who's got my back now ENDTOKEN
When all we have left is deceptive? ENDTOKEN
So disconnected ENDTOKEN
What is the truth now? ENDTOKEN
What is the truth now? ENDTOKEN
Tell me the truth now ENDTOKEN
What is the truth now? ENDTOKEN
What is the truth now? ENDTOKEN
Tell us the truth ENDTOKEN
Who's got my back now ENDTOKEN
When all we have left is deceptive? ENDTOKEN
So disconnected ENDTOKEN
What is the truth now? ENDTOKEN
Who's got my back now ENDTOKEN
When all we have left is deceptive? ENDTOKEN
So disconnected ENDTOKEN
What is the truth now? ENDTOKEN
What is the truth now? ENDTOKEN
Tell us the truth now ENDTOKEN
What is the truth now? ENDTOKEN
Tell us the truth now ENDTOKEN
(Tell me the truth now) ENDTOKEN
And some say ENDTOKEN
Why you follow if somethings so long? ENDTOKEN
So I asked him ENDTOKEN
And he convinced me before long ENDTOKEN
Now it's over ENDTOKEN
And I've seen him, don't come back anymore ENDTOKEN
And he said ENDTOKEN
I need ENDTOKEN
I don't ask much anymore ENDTOKEN
I found ENDTOKEN
I found something, yeah ENDTOKEN
Throw a stone into the water ENDTOKEN
The ripple is broke ENDTOKEN
Burn them, baby ENDTOKEN
Just for holding the candle too close ENDTOKEN
Take it all back ENDTOKEN
Search for justice, don't live there anymore ENDTOKEN
And he said ENDTOKEN
I need ENDTOKEN
I don't ask much anymore ENDTOKEN
I found ENDTOKEN
I found something, yeah ENDTOKEN
And why do you see me in this way? ENDTOKEN
The way that I did ENDTOKEN
I gave him the means to the ends ENDTOKEN
Yes, I did ENDTOKEN
I bothered not to believe in this way ENDTOKEN
The way that I did ENDTOKEN
I made him just to see in this way ENDTOKEN
The way that I did ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah ENDTOKEN
I need ENDTOKEN
I don't ask much anymore ENDTOKEN
I found ENDTOKEN
I found something, yeah ENDTOKEN
Fathers hands were lined with dirt ENDTOKEN
From long days in the field ENDTOKEN
And mothers hands are serving meals ENDTOKEN
In a café on Main Street ENDTOKEN
With mouths to feed ENDTOKEN
Just trying to keep clothing on our backs ENDTOKEN
And all I hear about ENDTOKEN
Is how it's so bad, it's so bad ENDTOKEN
It's too bad, it's stupid ENDTOKEN
Too late, so wrong, so long ENDTOKEN
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind ENDTOKEN
Let's walk, let's talk ENDTOKEN
(Let's talk) ENDTOKEN
You left without saying goodbye ENDTOKEN
Although I'm sure you tried ENDTOKEN
You call the house from time to time ENDTOKEN
To make sure we're alive ENDTOKEN
But you weren't there ENDTOKEN
Right when I needed you the most ENDTOKEN
And now I dream about it ENDTOKEN
And how it's so bad, it's so bad ENDTOKEN
It's too bad, it's stupid ENDTOKEN
Too late, so wrong, so long ENDTOKEN
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind ENDTOKEN
Let's walk, let's talk ENDTOKEN
Let's talk ENDTOKEN
It's too bad, it's stupid ENDTOKEN
Too late, so wrong, so long ENDTOKEN
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind ENDTOKEN
Let's walk, let's talk ENDTOKEN
Father's hands are lined with guilt ENDTOKEN
For tearing us apart ENDTOKEN
Guess it turned out in the end ENDTOKEN
Just look at where we are ENDTOKEN
We made it out ENDTOKEN
We still got clothing on our backs ENDTOKEN
And now I scream about it ENDTOKEN
And how it's so bad, it's so bad ENDTOKEN
It's too bad, it's stupid ENDTOKEN
Too late, so wrong, so long ENDTOKEN
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind ENDTOKEN
Let's walk, let's talk ENDTOKEN
It's too bad, it's stupid ENDTOKEN
Too late, so wrong, so long ENDTOKEN
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind ENDTOKEN
Let's walk, let's talk ENDTOKEN
Long time, let's walk, let's talk ENDTOKEN
Hey ENDTOKEN
Who's coming with me, to kick a hole in the sky? ENDTOKEN
I love the whiskey, let's drink that shit till it's dry ENDTOKEN
So grab a Jim Beam, JD, whatever you need ENDTOKEN
Have a shot from the bottle, doesn't matter to me ENDTOKEN
Another round, fill her up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up ENDTOKEN
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down ENDTOKEN
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out (Bottoms up) ENDTOKEN
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up ENDTOKEN
Drinking every drop until it all runs out ENDTOKEN
Another round, fill her up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up ENDTOKEN
Ooh, bottoms up ENDTOKEN
So grab your best friends and make your way to the bar ENDTOKEN
But keep your distance, we're gonna light it on fire ENDTOKEN
We're drinking black tooth, 80 proof, straight gasoline ENDTOKEN
Slam as much as you can take and hand the bottle to me ENDTOKEN
Another round, fill her up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up ENDTOKEN
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down ENDTOKEN
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out (Bottoms up) ENDTOKEN
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up ENDTOKEN
Drinking every drop until it all runs out ENDTOKEN
Another round, fill her up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up ENDTOKEN
Ooh, bottoms up ENDTOKEN
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down ENDTOKEN
We ain't gonna stop until they throw us all out ENDTOKEN
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up ENDTOKEN
Drinking every drop until it all runs out ENDTOKEN
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down ENDTOKEN
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out (Bottoms up) ENDTOKEN
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up ENDTOKEN
Drinking every drop until it all runs out ENDTOKEN
Another round, fill her up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up ENDTOKEN
Another round, fill her up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up ENDTOKEN
Hey, bottoms up ENDTOKEN
In the glare of a neon sign ENDTOKEN
She laid her body down ENDTOKEN
The damned walked in beside her ENDTOKEN
And he laid his money down ENDTOKEN
He said don't try to scream now ENDTOKEN
But I want this one to hurt ENDTOKEN
And tonight, my pretty one ENDTOKEN
I'm gonna get my money's worth ENDTOKEN
He said they never listen ENDTOKEN
She said they'd never understand ENDTOKEN
That I don't this for pleasure ENDTOKEN
I just do it cause I can ENDTOKEN
I swear I didn't want to ENDTOKEN
And I swear I didn't know ENDTOKEN
That things like this could happen ENDTOKEN
To a 17-year old ENDTOKEN
And I've bundled up all of these fears inside ENDTOKEN
And I've bottled up all of this pain ENDTOKEN
And no one or nothing can take this away ENDTOKEN
But I won't let it happen again ENDTOKEN
Never again ENDTOKEN
In the haze of a smoky room ENDTOKEN
He chokes that bottle down ENDTOKEN
It's been a month since her saw her face ENDTOKEN
Underneath the blood stained gown ENDTOKEN
He thinks about that little girl ENDTOKEN
And the one he has at home ENDTOKEN
And wonders, "What if that was my little girl ENDTOKEN
Walking down that road alone?" ENDTOKEN
And I've bundled up all of these fears inside ENDTOKEN
And I've bottled up all of this pain ENDTOKEN
And no one or nothing can take this away ENDTOKEN
But I won't let it happen again ENDTOKEN
Never again ENDTOKEN
Maybe I'm just crazy or the devil got inside ENDTOKEN
But either way my soul is gone, And I'll end this all tonight ENDTOKEN
The one hand throws the whiskey, and the other throws the gun ENDTOKEN
As he cries out to the heavens, "I am not my father's son" ENDTOKEN
And I've bundled up all of these fears inside ENDTOKEN
And I've bottled up all of this pain ENDTOKEN
And no one or nothing can take this away ENDTOKEN
But I won't let it happen again ENDTOKEN
Never again ENDTOKEN
It's the same thing ENDTOKEN
It's the same thing every time ENDTOKEN
Your way or nothing ENDTOKEN
It's a shame that ENDTOKEN
It's a shame that all this time ENDTOKEN
Things could have been much better here ENDTOKEN
Maybe something more defined ENDTOKEN
More than what you had in mind ENDTOKEN
More that I could have become ENDTOKEN
I could spend my whole life hanging ENDTOKEN
On your words that leave me here in doubt ENDTOKEN
But I’m so tired of being down and out ENDTOKEN
I'll do this my way now ENDTOKEN
You know you've been so wrong ENDTOKEN
For way too long ENDTOKEN
And now it shows ENDTOKEN
It shows that all you've ever wanted ENDTOKEN
Was to be the one ENDTOKEN
To put me down for what I’ve done ENDTOKEN
And no you're not the only one ENDTOKEN
But you will never be like me ENDTOKEN
I could spend my whole life hanging ENDTOKEN
On your words that leave me here in doubt ENDTOKEN
But I’m so tired of being down and out ENDTOKEN
I'll do this my way now ENDTOKEN
I'll do this my way now ENDTOKEN
With all that you know, tell me who will you hurt ENDTOKEN
And where will you go, when you get what you deserve ENDTOKEN
I could spend my whole life hanging ENDTOKEN
On your words that leave me here in doubt ENDTOKEN
But I’m so tired of being down and out ENDTOKEN
I'll do this my way now ENDTOKEN
I could spend my whole life hanging ENDTOKEN
On your words that leave me here in doubt ENDTOKEN
But I’m so tired of being down and out ENDTOKEN
I'll do this my way now ENDTOKEN
I'll do this my way now ENDTOKEN
I'll do this my way now ENDTOKEN
Do this my way now ENDTOKEN
I hope you’re doing fine out there without me ENDTOKEN
‘Cause I’m not doing so good without you ENDTOKEN
The things I thought you’d never know about me ENDTOKEN
Were the things I guess you always understood ENDTOKEN
So how could I have been so blind for all these years? ENDTOKEN
Guess I only see the truth through all this fear ENDTOKEN
And living without you ENDTOKEN
And everything I have in this world ENDTOKEN
And all that I’ll ever be ENDTOKEN
It could all fall down around me ENDTOKEN
Just as long as I have you ENDTOKEN
Right here by me ENDTOKEN
I can’t take another day without you ENDTOKEN
‘Cause baby, I could never make it on my own ENDTOKEN
I’ve been waiting so long, just to hold you ENDTOKEN
And to be back in your arms where I belong ENDTOKEN
Sorry I can’t always find the words to say ENDTOKEN
But everything I’ve ever known gets swept away ENDTOKEN
Inside of your love ENDTOKEN
And everything I have in this world ENDTOKEN
And all that I’ll ever be ENDTOKEN
It could all fall down around me ENDTOKEN
Just as long as I have you ENDTOKEN
Right here by me ENDTOKEN
As the days grow long I see ENDTOKEN
Time is standing still for me ENDTOKEN
When you’re not here ENDTOKEN
Sorry I can’t always find the words to say ENDTOKEN
But everything I’ve ever known gets swept away ENDTOKEN
Inside of your love ENDTOKEN
And everything I have in this world ENDTOKEN
And all that I’ll ever be ENDTOKEN
It could all fall down around me ENDTOKEN
Just as long as I have you ENDTOKEN
Right here by me ENDTOKEN
And everything I have in this world ENDTOKEN
And all that I’ll ever be ENDTOKEN
It could all fall down around me ENDTOKEN
Just as long as I have you ENDTOKEN
Right here by me ENDTOKEN
I can't find the rhyme in all my reason ENDTOKEN
Lost sense of time and all seasons ENDTOKEN
Feel I've been beaten down ENDTOKEN
By the words of men who have no grounds ENDTOKEN
Can't sleep beneath the trees of wisdom ENDTOKEN
When your ax has cut the roots that feed them ENDTOKEN
Forked tongues in bitter mouths ENDTOKEN
Can drive a man to bleed from inside out ENDTOKEN
What if you did? ENDTOKEN
What if you lied? ENDTOKEN
What if I avenge? ENDTOKEN
What if eye for an eye? ENDTOKEN
I've seen the wicked fruit of your vine ENDTOKEN
Destroy the man who lacks a strong mind ENDTOKEN
Human pride sings a vengeful song ENDTOKEN
Inspired by the times you've been walked on ENDTOKEN
My stage is shared by many millions ENDTOKEN
Who lift their hands up high because they feel this ENDTOKEN
We are one, we are strong ENDTOKEN
The more you hold us down, the more we press on ENDTOKEN
I know I can't hold my hate inside my mind ENDTOKEN
Because what consumes your thoughts controls your life ENDTOKEN
So I'll just ask a question, a lonely, simple question ENDTOKEN
I'll just ask one question ENDTOKEN
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I? ENDTOKEN
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I? ENDTOKEN
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I? ENDTOKEN
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I? ENDTOKEN
What if you did? ENDTOKEN
What if you lied? ENDTOKEN
What if I avenge? ENDTOKEN
What if eye for an eye? ENDTOKEN
What if your words ENDTOKEN
Could be judged like a crime? ENDTOKEN
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I? ENDTOKEN
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I? ENDTOKEN
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I? ENDTOKEN
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I? ENDTOKEN
Riders on the storm ENDTOKEN
Riders on the storm ENDTOKEN
Into this house we're born ENDTOKEN
Into this world we're thrown ENDTOKEN
Like a dog without a bone ENDTOKEN
An actor out on loan ENDTOKEN
Riders on the storm ENDTOKEN
There's a killer on the road ENDTOKEN
His brain is squirming like a toad ENDTOKEN
Take a long holiday ENDTOKEN
Let your children play ENDTOKEN
If you give this man a ride ENDTOKEN
Sweet family will die ENDTOKEN
Killer on the road ENDTOKEN
Girl, you got to love your man[x2] ENDTOKEN
Take him by the hand ENDTOKEN
Make him understand ENDTOKEN
The world on you depends ENDTOKEN
Our life will never end ENDTOKEN
Girl, you got to love your man ENDTOKEN
Riders on the storm[x4] ENDTOKEN
Caught up in the middle ENDTOKEN
Had no choice, had no choice ENDTOKEN
Birthright forgotten ENDTOKEN
So silent, no voice ENDTOKEN
I see you, you know who ENDTOKEN
Little sister, little sister ENDTOKEN
Now realized little sister ENDTOKEN
Over looked little girl ENDTOKEN
Now realized little sister ENDTOKEN
Over looked little girl ENDTOKEN
Bottled up and empty holding back ENDTOKEN
At loss, your forgotten getting back, get back ENDTOKEN
Bottled up and empty holding back ENDTOKEN
At loss, your forgotten getting back ENDTOKEN
Get back, get back, get back, yeah ENDTOKEN
Expectations of another ENDTOKEN
Love given to the younger ENDTOKEN
Broken father, broken brother ENDTOKEN
Emptiness feeds the hunger ENDTOKEN
I see you, you know who ENDTOKEN
Little sister, little sister ENDTOKEN
Change[x3] ENDTOKEN
If you could step into my head ENDTOKEN
Tell me, would you still know me? ENDTOKEN
If you woke up in my bed ENDTOKEN
Tell me, would you hold me ENDTOKEN
Or would you simply let it lie ENDTOKEN
Leaving me to wonder why? ENDTOKEN
I can’t get you out of this head ENDTOKEN
I call mine and I will say ENDTOKEN
Oh no, I can’t let you go ENDTOKEN
My little girl ENDTOKEN
Because you’re holding up my world ENDTOKEN
So I need you ENDTOKEN
Your imitation of my walk ENDTOKEN
And the perfect way you talk ENDTOKEN
It’s just a couple of the million things ENDTOKEN
That I love about you ENDTOKEN
So I need you ENDTOKEN
So I need you ENDTOKEN
So I need you ENDTOKEN
So I need you ENDTOKEN
And if I jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge ENDTOKEN
Tell me, would you still follow me? ENDTOKEN
And if I made you mad today ENDTOKEN
Tell me, would you love me tomorrow? Please? ENDTOKEN
Or would you say that you don’t care ENDTOKEN
And then leave me standing here ENDTOKEN
Like the fool who is drowning in despair ENDTOKEN
And screaming? ENDTOKEN
Oh no, I can’t let you go ENDTOKEN
My little girl ENDTOKEN
Because you’re holding up my world ENDTOKEN
So I need you ENDTOKEN
Your imitation of my walk ENDTOKEN
And the perfect way you talk ENDTOKEN
It’s just a couple of the million things ENDTOKEN
That I love about you ENDTOKEN
So I need you ENDTOKEN
So I need you ENDTOKEN
So I need you ENDTOKEN
So I need you ENDTOKEN
I’m on my own ENDTOKEN
I’m on my own ENDTOKEN
I’m on my own ENDTOKEN
Oh, oh, can't let you go ENDTOKEN
My little girl ENDTOKEN
Because you’re holding up my world ENDTOKEN
So I need you ENDTOKEN
Your imitation of my walk ENDTOKEN
And the perfect way you talk ENDTOKEN
It’s just a couple of the million things ENDTOKEN
That I love about you ENDTOKEN
So I need you ENDTOKEN
So I need you ENDTOKEN
So I need you ENDTOKEN
So I need you ENDTOKEN
Baby, yeah ENDTOKEN
Things that they say ENDTOKEN
I'm so tired of games that they play ENDTOKEN
Always pretending that they know what comes at the ending ENDTOKEN
Well they brought the lies and believe there's no freedom ENDTOKEN
We'll be the ones who can say we don't need them ENDTOKEN
Come on, come on ENDTOKEN
Let's enjoy the ride ENDTOKEN
Cause we only know what's inside of these lines ENDTOKEN
And I wanna know what's on the other side ENDTOKEN
And we'll keep on going until there's only us and the night ENDTOKEN
Some people pay to make us believe the things that I say ENDTOKEN
But I don't ENDTOKEN
What they don't know is we got so much more than we show ENDTOKEN
They only want us to think that they're stronger ENDTOKEN
Now we don't have to pretend any longer ENDTOKEN
Come on, come on ENDTOKEN
Let's enjoy the ride ENDTOKEN
Cause we only know what's inside of these lines ENDTOKEN
And I wanna know what's on the other side ENDTOKEN
And we'll keep on going until there's only us and the night ENDTOKEN
I've spent my whole life waiting for this day to come ENDTOKEN
Now at last I see I'm not the only one ENDTOKEN
So come on, come on ENDTOKEN
Come on, come on ENDTOKEN
Come on, come on ENDTOKEN
Come on, come on ENDTOKEN
Let's enjoy the ride ENDTOKEN
Cause we only know what's inside of these lines ENDTOKEN
And I wanna know what's on the other side ENDTOKEN
And we'll keep on going until there's only us and the night ENDTOKEN
Come on, come on ENDTOKEN
Let's enjoy the ride ENDTOKEN
Cause we only know what's inside of these lines ENDTOKEN
And I wanna know what's on the other side ENDTOKEN
And we'll keep on going until there's only us ENDTOKEN
Cloud in my mind ENDTOKEN
Trouble my thoughts ENDTOKEN
Your silence is beauty ENDTOKEN
But your beauty is lost ENDTOKEN
There's a sandy man hidden ENDTOKEN
You seven times think ENDTOKEN
That you're very tired and ridden ENDTOKEN
But you never once blink ENDTOKEN
There's a man in my mind ENDTOKEN
Kickin' in the walls ENDTOKEN
Trailin' my innocence ENDTOKEN
Paralyzing all my thoughts ENDTOKEN
Got a wide eyed view ENDTOKEN
From a chemical thrill ENDTOKEN
Set in the pace of time ENDTOKEN
And prowlin' the killin' field ENDTOKEN
Tracer from far away ENDTOKEN
To this life in my empty cell ENDTOKEN
It seems life is just a lie ENDTOKEN
But there's still the lie to tell ENDTOKEN
There's a man in my mind ENDTOKEN
Kickin' in the walls ENDTOKEN
Trailin' my innocence ENDTOKEN
Paralyzing all my thoughts ENDTOKEN
There's a man in my mind ENDTOKEN
Kickin' in the walls ENDTOKEN
Trailin' my innocence ENDTOKEN
Paralyzing all my thoughts ENDTOKEN
There's man in my mind ENDTOKEN
There's a man ENDTOKEN
The man in mine ENDTOKEN
You walked away in silence ENDTOKEN
You walked away to breathe ENDTOKEN
Stopped and turned around to say goodbye to me ENDTOKEN
I'm pleading as you're leaving, I'm begging you stay ENDTOKEN
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed ENDTOKEN
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed ENDTOKEN
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love ENDTOKEN
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love ENDTOKEN
If my life is the price, then my life it will cost ENDTOKEN
Now that I'm picking up the pieces ENDTOKEN
See the pain that I have caused ENDTOKEN
It's hard to believe in someone you thought was lost ENDTOKEN
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love ENDTOKEN
Don't you walk away in silence ENDTOKEN
In tears you counted reasons ENDTOKEN
Tears covered you it seemed ENDTOKEN
Face down screaming "God help me please" ENDTOKEN
I'm pleading as you're leaving, I'm begging you to stay ENDTOKEN
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed ENDTOKEN
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed ENDTOKEN
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love ENDTOKEN
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love ENDTOKEN

Don't give up on us, don't give up on love ENDTOKEN
Don't you walk away in silence ENDTOKEN
Please come back to me ENDTOKEN
Don't you walk away in silence ENDTOKEN
I'm not the man I used to be ENDTOKEN
(Well I pray that tomorrow you'll be home) ENDTOKEN
We can rebuild and forever, we can go on, go on, and go on ENDTOKEN
We can go on ENDTOKEN
(Well I pray that tomorrow you'll be home) ENDTOKEN
Look at horizons and let the light bring you home ENDTOKEN
Bring you home ENDTOKEN
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love ENDTOKEN
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love ENDTOKEN
If my life is the price, then my life it will cost ENDTOKEN

It's hard to believe in someone you thought was lost ENDTOKEN
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love ENDTOKEN
Don't walk away in silence, please don't walk away ENDTOKEN
Don't walk away in silence ENDTOKEN
I'm not the man I used to be ENDTOKEN
You're stuck on a chain ENDTOKEN
And your toeing a lie ENDTOKEN
Seems like every time that you catch up ENDTOKEN
You only fall behind ENDTOKEN
And you're trapped inside this world you made yourself ENDTOKEN
But that's not the world I live in ENDTOKEN
This is not the life for me ENDTOKEN
'Cause my world's bigger than your problems ENDTOKEN
And it's bigger than me ENDTOKEN
That's not the world I live in ENDTOKEN
This is not the life for me ENDTOKEN
'Cause my world's bigger than your problems ENDTOKEN
And it's bigger than me ENDTOKEN
There is always someone to blame ENDTOKEN
For the things you do yourself ENDTOKEN
You think that everything that's going wrong ENDTOKEN
Is because of someone else ENDTOKEN
And you're trapped inside this world you made yourself ENDTOKEN
And that's not the world I live in ENDTOKEN
This is not the life for me ENDTOKEN
'Cause my world's bigger than your problems ENDTOKEN
And it's bigger than me ENDTOKEN
That's not the world I live in ENDTOKEN
This is not the life for me ENDTOKEN
'Cause my world's bigger than your problems ENDTOKEN
And it's bigger than me ENDTOKEN
And it's bigger than me ENDTOKEN
(Oh, oh, oh, woah, woah) ENDTOKEN
'Cause I'm on the outside and I'm looking in ENDTOKEN
And that's not the world I live in ENDTOKEN
This is not the life for me ENDTOKEN
'Cause my world's bigger than your problems ENDTOKEN
And it's bigger than me ENDTOKEN
That's not the world I live in ENDTOKEN
This is not the life for me ENDTOKEN
'Cause my world's bigger than your problems ENDTOKEN
And it's bigger than me ENDTOKEN
'Cause my world is bigger than your problems ENDTOKEN
And it's bigger than me ENDTOKEN
Not like I need to depend upon anyone ENDTOKEN
Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all ENDTOKEN
One more anthem for the know it all ENDTOKEN
I won't be standing up for long ENDTOKEN
I better learn how to crawl ENDTOKEN
Learn how to crawl ENDTOKEN
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor ENDTOKEN
Like I need to defend my own innocence ENDTOKEN
So what, I did it, I admit it, and I'm pleading the 5th ENDTOKEN
One more anthem for the know it all ENDTOKEN
I won't be standing up for long ENDTOKEN
I better learn how to crawl ENDTOKEN
Learn how to crawl ENDTOKEN
In ten minutes, I'll be laying out flat on the floor ENDTOKEN
Eight minutes from losing it a little bit ENDTOKEN
Five minutes, your description might be starting to fit ENDTOKEN
Three to go and I'm forgetting all that I've ever known ENDTOKEN
I won't be standing up for long ENDTOKEN
I better learn how to crawl ENDTOKEN
Not like I need to depend upon anyone ENDTOKEN
Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all ENDTOKEN
One more anthem for the know it all ENDTOKEN
I won't be standing up for long ENDTOKEN
I better learn how to crawl ENDTOKEN
Learn how to crawl ENDTOKEN
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor ENDTOKEN
I can't stand up at all ENDTOKEN
Can't see nothing at all ENDTOKEN
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor ENDTOKEN
Well, it's midnight, damn right, we're wound up too tight ENDTOKEN
I've got a fist full of whiskey, the bottle just bit me ENDTOKEN
Oh ENDTOKEN
That shit makes me bat shit crazy ENDTOKEN
We've got no fear, no doubt, all in, balls out ENDTOKEN
We're going out tonight (Hey!) ENDTOKEN
To kick out every light (Hey!) ENDTOKEN
Take anything we want (Hey!) ENDTOKEN
Drink everything in sight (Hey!) ENDTOKEN
We're going till the world stops turning ENDTOKEN
While we burn it to the ground tonight ENDTOKEN
Ooh ENDTOKEN
Ooh ENDTOKEN
We're screaming like demons, swinging from the ceiling ENDTOKEN
I got a fist full of fifties, tequila just hit me ENDTOKEN
Oh ENDTOKEN
We got no class, no taste, no shirt, and shit faced ENDTOKEN
We got it lined up, shot down, firing back straight crown ENDTOKEN
We're going out tonight (Hey!) ENDTOKEN
To kick out every light (Hey!) ENDTOKEN
Take anything we want (Hey!) ENDTOKEN
Drink everything in sight (Hey!) ENDTOKEN
We're going till the world stops turning ENDTOKEN
While we burn it to the ground tonight ENDTOKEN
Ooh ENDTOKEN

Tickin' like a time bomb, drinkin' till the nights gone ENDTOKEN

While we burn it to the ground tonight ENDTOKEN
The Devil went down to Georgia ENDTOKEN
He was lookin' for a soul to steal ENDTOKEN
He was in a bind the way behind and willing to make a deal ENDTOKEN
When he came across this young man pickin' a guitar and playin' it hot ENDTOKEN
The Devil jumped up on a hickory stump and said, "Boy, let me tell you what." ENDTOKEN
"I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a guitar player, too ENDTOKEN
And if you'd care to take this dare I'll make a bet with you ENDTOKEN
Now you a pretty damn good strummer, boy, but give the Devil his due ENDTOKEN
I'll bet a guitar of gold against your soul that says I'm better than you" ENDTOKEN
But the boy said, "My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin ENDTOKEN
But I'll take your bet; you're gonna regret, I'm the best there's ever been." ENDTOKEN
The Devil opened up his case and he said, "I'll start this show." ENDTOKEN
And fire flew from his fingertips as he tuned his axe down low ENDTOKEN
And he pulled that pick across the strings and it made an evil hiss ENDTOKEN
Then a band of demons all joined in and it sounded just like this ENDTOKEN
When the Devil finished, Johnny said, "Well, you're pretty good, old son ENDTOKEN
Well sit your old ass in that chair right there, let me show you how the fuck it's done." ENDTOKEN
The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat ENDTOKEN
And he laid that gold guitar down on the ground at Johnny's feet ENDTOKEN
But Johnny said, "Devil, just come on back, if you ever wanna try again ENDTOKEN
I done told you once, you son of a bitch, I'm the best that's ever been." ENDTOKEN
Wake up ENDTOKEN
My baby still looks amazing with no makeup ENDTOKEN
And dammit I knew the second that you came up ENDTOKEN
From underneath the covers ENDTOKEN
Said "I wanna meet your mother, your daddy, your sister and your brother" ENDTOKEN
One week, the time it took you to tell me that you love me ENDTOKEN
Packed all of my shit and moved across the country ENDTOKEN
And now we're buying diamonds ENDTOKEN
Saying it's only 20 karats, it can't be that hard to find it, baby ENDTOKEN
Your touch has made me a believer ENDTOKEN
Your love is all I ever needed ENDTOKEN
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity ENDTOKEN
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round ENDTOKEN
She takes like the sunshine kissing me ENDTOKEN
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee ENDTOKEN
And she said, "Honey, if you want to you can come with me" ENDTOKEN
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round ENDTOKEN
She takes like the sunshine kissing me ENDTOKEN
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee ENDTOKEN
And she said, "Honey, if you want to you can come with me" ENDTOKEN
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round ENDTOKEN
Out on sunset ENDTOKEN
I can't imagine that you ain't having fun yet ENDTOKEN
Baby maybe just wait cause I ain't drunk yet ENDTOKEN
As soon as I looked over ENDTOKEN

You were busy motorboatin' on that blonde, girl ENDTOKEN
Keep up with what you doing ENDTOKEN
Ain't nothing wrong girl ENDTOKEN
Looks like we got another come along, girl ENDTOKEN
If you ain't afraid to try it ENDTOKEN
You know we'll be flying private as long as I can be the pilot, baby ENDTOKEN

Can't replace that face, that waist ENDTOKEN
I'd chase this girl like Belvidere ENDTOKEN
Baby ENDTOKEN
She takes like the sunshine kissing me ENDTOKEN
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee ENDTOKEN
And she said, "Honey, if you want to you can come with me" ENDTOKEN
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round ENDTOKEN
She takes like the sunshine kissing me ENDTOKEN
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee ENDTOKEN
And she said, "Honey, if you want to you can come with me" ENDTOKEN
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round ENDTOKEN
Oh, oh ENDTOKEN
Oh, oh ENDTOKEN
Oh, oh ENDTOKEN
Oh, oh ENDTOKEN

She's got me runnin' round and round ENDTOKEN
Oh, oh ENDTOKEN
Oh, oh ENDTOKEN
Oh, oh ENDTOKEN
Oh, oh ENDTOKEN
Oh, oh ENDTOKEN
Oh, oh ENDTOKEN
She's got me runnin' round and round ENDTOKEN
This is not about age ENDTOKEN
Time served on the earth ENDTOKEN
Doesn't mean you grow in mind ENDTOKEN
Grow in mind ENDTOKEN
This is not about God ENDTOKEN
Spiritual insinuations seem ENDTOKEN
To shock our nation ENDTOKEN
Our nation, yeah ENDTOKEN
Come with me, I'm fading ENDTOKEN
Underneath the lights ENDTOKEN
Come with me, come with me ENDTOKEN
Come with me now ENDTOKEN
This is not about race ENDTOKEN
It's a decision to stop the ENDTOKEN
Division in your life ENDTOKEN
In our lives ENDTOKEN
This is not about sex (Sex!) ENDTOKEN
We all know sex sells and ENDTOKEN
The whole world is buying ENDTOKEN
We're buying, yeah ENDTOKEN
Come with me, I'm fading ENDTOKEN
Underneath the lights ENDTOKEN
Come with me, come with me ENDTOKEN
Come with me now ENDTOKEN
Can't you see the signs? ENDTOKEN
See the signs now ENDTOKEN
Can't you see the signs? ENDTOKEN
See the signs now ENDTOKEN
Can't you see the signs? ENDTOKEN
See the signs now ENDTOKEN
Can't you see the signs? ENDTOKEN
See the signs now ENDTOKEN
Can't you see the signs? ENDTOKEN
See the signs now ENDTOKEN
Can't you see the signs? ENDTOKEN
See the signs now ENDTOKEN
Yeah, come on ENDTOKEN
See them, yeah ENDTOKEN
Come with me, I'm fading ENDTOKEN
Underneath the lights ENDTOKEN
Come with me, come with me ENDTOKEN
Come with me now ENDTOKEN
Can't you see them? ENDTOKEN
See the signs, you see them ENDTOKEN
All the signs, we see them ENDTOKEN
Can't you see them? ENDTOKEN
See the signs, you see them ENDTOKEN
All the signs, we see them ENDTOKEN
A nature to nurture ENDTOKEN
An instinct to sin ENDTOKEN
What's underneath the skin you live in? ENDTOKEN
You trade your unlimited ENDTOKEN
Your precious creation ENDTOKEN
You will submit ENDTOKEN
You will get it ENDTOKEN
Suddenly I have no strength at all ENDTOKEN
So suddenly hit with all I've lost ENDTOKEN
Suddenly my world is falling apart ENDTOKEN
So suddenly, so suddenly ENDTOKEN
Suddenly ENDTOKEN
You say you're a victim ENDTOKEN
But that's just a symptom ENDTOKEN
You're so very clear ENDTOKEN
You volunteered ENDTOKEN
Why are you fighting just stop your denying ENDTOKEN
Own up to the sin ENDTOKEN
You bury within ENDTOKEN
I have no strength at all ENDTOKEN
I've been hit with a loss ENDTOKEN
So suddenly my world falls apart ENDTOKEN
I have no strength at all ENDTOKEN
I've been hit with a loss ENDTOKEN
Suddenly my world falls apart ENDTOKEN
My world falls apart ENDTOKEN
It's down to this ENDTOKEN
I've got to make this life make sense ENDTOKEN
Can anyone tell what I've done? ENDTOKEN
I miss the life ENDTOKEN
I miss the colors of the World ENDTOKEN
Can anyone tell where I am? ENDTOKEN
'Cause now again I've found myself so far down ENDTOKEN
Away from the Sun that shines into the darkest place ENDTOKEN
I'm so far down, away from the Sun again ENDTOKEN
Away from the sun again ENDTOKEN
I'm over this ENDTOKEN
I'm tired of living in the dark ENDTOKEN
Can anyone see me down here? ENDTOKEN
The feeling's gone ENDTOKEN
There's nothing left to lift me up ENDTOKEN
Back into the world I know ENDTOKEN
'Cause now again I've found myself so far down ENDTOKEN
Away from the Sun that shines into the darkest place ENDTOKEN
I'm so far down, away from the Sun again ENDTOKEN
Away from the Sun ENDTOKEN
That shines to light the way for me ENDTOKEN
To find my way back into the arms ENDTOKEN
That care about the ones like me ENDTOKEN
I'm so far down, away from the Sun again ENDTOKEN
Oh, no ENDTOKEN
Yeah ENDTOKEN
Oh, no ENDTOKEN
It's down to this ENDTOKEN
I've got to make this life make sense ENDTOKEN
And now I can't tell what I've done ENDTOKEN
And now again I've found myself ENDTOKEN
So far down, away from the Sun ENDTOKEN
That shines to light the way for me ENDTOKEN
'Cause now again I've found myself so far down ENDTOKEN
Away from the Sun that shines into the darkest place ENDTOKEN
I'm so far down, away from the Sun again ENDTOKEN
Away from the Sun ENDTOKEN
That shines to light the way for me ENDTOKEN
To find my way back into the arms ENDTOKEN
That care about the ones like me ENDTOKEN
I'm so far down, away from the Sun again ENDTOKEN
Oh, no ENDTOKEN
Yeah ENDTOKEN
I'm gone... ENDTOKEN
I would have been in doubt ENDTOKEN
When this started out ENDTOKEN
That everything would turn out this way ENDTOKEN
First it was a phone call ENDTOKEN
Then it was another ENDTOKEN
From a mother who was ready to play ENDTOKEN
She said things that no one ever told me before ENDTOKEN
But how could I have known ENDTOKEN
That she wanted to settle a score ENDTOKEN
Then a man came in ENDTOKEN
I can finally see it ENDTOKEN
And it looks like you're having fun ENDTOKEN
But when I get back ENDTOKEN
You're gonna be bleeding ENDTOKEN
So I think son you better run ENDTOKEN
Now I think I should be leaving ENDTOKEN
Cause it looks like I’ve had enough ENDTOKEN
She was a deceiver but I had to believe her ENDTOKEN
When she told me she was in love ENDTOKEN
I knew I could fix it ENDTOKEN
In just another minute ENDTOKEN
But I guess it was a minute too late ENDTOKEN
I knew he was coming ENDTOKEN
And I should have been running ENDTOKEN
If he caught me I would never escape ENDTOKEN
Now I know it never should have been a surprise ENDTOKEN
But how could I have known ENDTOKEN
That she was only telling me lies ENDTOKEN
Cause a man came in ENDTOKEN
I thought you were leaving ENDTOKEN
But I see you're still having fun ENDTOKEN
Now I’m back and you're gonna be bleeding ENDTOKEN
So I think son you better run ENDTOKEN
Now I see I should be leaving ENDTOKEN
Cause it looks like I’ve done enough ENDTOKEN
She was a deceiver but I had to believe her ENDTOKEN
When she told me she was in love ENDTOKEN
Don't blame me ENDTOKEN
It's not my fault ENDTOKEN
Don't blame me ENDTOKEN
I'm not the one ENDTOKEN
Cause a man came in ENDTOKEN
I thought you were leaving ENDTOKEN
But I see you're still having fun ENDTOKEN
Now I’m back and you're gonna be bleeding ENDTOKEN
So I think son you better run ENDTOKEN
Now I see I should be leaving ENDTOKEN
Cause it looks like I’ve done enough ENDTOKEN
She was a deceiver but I had to believe her ENDTOKEN
When she told me she was in love ENDTOKEN
She told me she was in love ENDTOKEN
Two steps closer ENDTOKEN
A thousand steps away ENDTOKEN
Wait to the system ENDTOKEN
Until I know other way ENDTOKEN
My hands blistered ENDTOKEN
But now numb to the pain ENDTOKEN
My mind twisted ENDTOKEN
In this cruel democracy ENDTOKEN
But now I'm free ENDTOKEN
Now I'm free ENDTOKEN
Feels like a thousand years ENDTOKEN
Taken from me ENDTOKEN
Choose my priorities ENDTOKEN
But they're shoved ENDTOKEN
In my face ENDTOKEN
My destiny in life ENDTOKEN
So far away ENDTOKEN
So far away ENDTOKEN
But now I'm free ENDTOKEN
Now I'm free ENDTOKEN
Oh, I guess it was a good ride ENDTOKEN
But looking back I feel the same ENDTOKEN
I guess it was a last time, no regrets ENDTOKEN
Who's to blame? ENDTOKEN
Show me how to live my life now ENDTOKEN
Very different from my own ENDTOKEN
A simple explanation ENDTOKEN
Further from the torn hole ENDTOKEN
I'm leaving now ENDTOKEN
I said I'm leaving now ENDTOKEN
I said I'm leaving now ENDTOKEN
And I got no place to go ENDTOKEN
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah ENDTOKEN
I said I'm leaving now ENDTOKEN
I said I'm leaving now ENDTOKEN
I said I'm leaving now ENDTOKEN
And I got no place to go ENDTOKEN
But now I'm free ENDTOKEN
Now I'm free ENDTOKEN
Now I'm free, yeah ENDTOKEN
Now I'm free, yeah ENDTOKEN
I stand surrounded by the walls that once confined me ENDTOKEN
Knowing I'll be underneath them ENDTOKEN
When they crumble when they fall ENDTOKEN
With clarity my scars remind me ENDTOKEN
Ash still simmers just under my skin ENDTOKEN
Difference smiles again ENDTOKEN
So much I hide ENDTOKEN
How is stepping back a move forward? ENDTOKEN
Now I'm forced to look behind ENDTOKEN
I'm forced to look at you ENDTOKEN
You wear a thousand faces ENDTOKEN
Tell me, tell mewhich is you ENDTOKEN
Broken mirrors paint the floor ENDTOKEN
Why can't you see the truth ENDTOKEN
You wear a thousand faces ENDTOKEN
Tell me, tell me which is you ENDTOKEN
Tell me which is you ENDTOKEN
Eerily time made no change ENDTOKEN
Pointing fingers, laying blame ENDTOKEN
Lying over and over and over and over ENDTOKEN
Deceiving your mind ENDTOKEN
Dug my grave, trash my name ENDTOKEN
Yet here I stand so you won't fade away ENDTOKEN
Difference smiles again ENDTOKEN
So much I hide ENDTOKEN
How is stepping back a move forward? ENDTOKEN
Now I'm forced to look behind ENDTOKEN
I'm forced to look at you ENDTOKEN
You wear a thousand faces ENDTOKEN
Tell me, tell me which is you ENDTOKEN
Broken mirrors paint the floor ENDTOKEN
Why can't you see the truth ENDTOKEN
You wear a thousand faces ENDTOKEN
Tell me, tell me which is you ENDTOKEN
Tell me which is you ENDTOKEN
I bleed inside ENDTOKEN
Just let it out ENDTOKEN
Just let it out ENDTOKEN
I bleed inside ENDTOKEN
Just let it out ENDTOKEN
I'm going to let it out ENDTOKEN
Just let it out ENDTOKEN
Just let it out ENDTOKEN
Let it die ENDTOKEN
Now I'm forced to look behind ENDTOKEN
I'm forced to look at you ENDTOKEN
You wear a thousand faces ENDTOKEN
Tell me, tell me which is you ENDTOKEN
Broken mirrors paint the floor ENDTOKEN
Why can't you see the truth ENDTOKEN
You wear a thousand faces ENDTOKEN
Tell me, tell me which is you ENDTOKEN
Tell me, tell me,tell me, tell me ENDTOKEN
Tell me which is you ENDTOKEN
You wear a thousand faces ENDTOKEN
Tell me which is you ENDTOKEN
Tell me which is you ENDTOKEN
The first words that come out ENDTOKEN
And I can see this song will be about you ENDTOKEN
I can't believe that I can breathe without you ENDTOKEN
But all I need to do is carry on ENDTOKEN
The next line I write down ENDTOKEN
And there's a tear that falls between the pages ENDTOKEN
I know that pain's supposed to heal in stages ENDTOKEN
But it depends which one I'm standing on ENDTOKEN
I write lines down, then rip them up ENDTOKEN
Describing love can't be this tough ENDTOKEN
I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if ENDTOKEN
I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly ENDTOKEN
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon ENDTOKEN
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much ENDTOKEN
Unless I sing this song to you ENDTOKEN
I'm dying to show you ENDTOKEN
This could end happily ever after ENDTOKEN
There doesn't ever have to be disaster ENDTOKEN
And all you have to do is sing along ENDTOKEN
I write lines down, then rip them up ENDTOKEN
Impossible describing love ENDTOKEN
I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if ENDTOKEN
I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly ENDTOKEN
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon ENDTOKEN
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much ENDTOKEN
Unless I sing this song to you ENDTOKEN
I could set this song on fire ENDTOKEN
Sing this song to you ENDTOKEN
I could set this song on fire ENDTOKEN
Light this old guitar on fire, I'd still hear the notes ENDTOKEN
Drown the melody in water, I'd still hear its ghost ENDTOKEN
Sing it with somebody else, but we'd be out of tune ENDTOKEN
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much ENDTOKEN
I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if ENDTOKEN
I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly ENDTOKEN
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon ENDTOKEN
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much ENDTOKEN
Unless I sing this song to you ENDTOKEN
I could set this song on fire ENDTOKEN
Unless I sing this song to you ENDTOKEN
I could set this, I could set this ENDTOKEN
I wanna sing this song to you ENDTOKEN
I could set this song on fire ENDTOKEN
Sing this song to you ENDTOKEN
I could set this, I could set this ENDTOKEN
The rage in my eyes ENDTOKEN
Could have compared to the eye of a sun ENDTOKEN
Then rain ENDTOKEN
Took it's course through the hands of the Son ENDTOKEN
Repent for all time ENDTOKEN
The world is at war leaving all fault behind ENDTOKEN
So is this the end for us my friend?[x2] ENDTOKEN
The stains in the sky ENDTOKEN
Are there to remind us of man and his fight ENDTOKEN
When two worlds collide ENDTOKEN
One steals the life like a thief in the night ENDTOKEN
So look to the sky ENDTOKEN
He hold the keys for your life and mine ENDTOKEN
Well as though we rise ENDTOKEN
As the day breaks the dawn ENDTOKEN
And as the moon hides the sun ENDTOKEN
Oh, the sun ENDTOKEN
No more sorrow ENDTOKEN
All those crying days are gone ENDTOKEN
No more sorrow ENDTOKEN
Now it's gone[x3] ENDTOKEN
She says, I got something to say ENDTOKEN
She knows what she says will change everything ENDTOKEN
She's laid through so many sleepless nights ENDTOKEN
She’s crying, she’s crying, she’s crying ENDTOKEN
Mother, that man took my soul away ENDTOKEN
Father, how could you ever treat me this way? ENDTOKEN
Brother, don't ever let him do this again ENDTOKEN
This time it’s over, I’m gonna make it end ENDTOKEN
Now it’s over and the old man is dead ENDTOKEN
Lying on the ground, bullet in his head ENDTOKEN
She stood at the foot of the guilty bed last night ENDTOKEN
She held what could set her free for the rest of her life ENDTOKEN
She did all that she said that she planned to do ENDTOKEN
She’s through, she’s through, she’s through, yeah ENDTOKEN
Mother, that man took my soul away ENDTOKEN
Father, how could you ever treat me this way? ENDTOKEN
Brother, don't ever let him do this again ENDTOKEN
This time it’s over, I’m gonna make it end ENDTOKEN
Now it’s over and the old man is dead ENDTOKEN
Lying on the ground, bullet in his head ENDTOKEN
There’s a bullet in your head ENDTOKEN
I kept falling down, look who's falling now ENDTOKEN
I kept crying out, look who's crying now ENDTOKEN
I kept falling down, look who's falling now ENDTOKEN
I’m ready, I’m ready, I’m ready ENDTOKEN
Now it’s over, this is what she said ENDTOKEN
He's lying on the ground, bullet in his head ENDTOKEN
You stand before me ENDTOKEN
Now we stare eye to eye ENDTOKEN
Before another second clicks away, one of us will die ENDTOKEN
You reach for your metal as I reach for mine ENDTOKEN
The sound of bullets flying through the air is followed by a cry ENDTOKEN
And they're crying ENDTOKEN
What will we do, what will we say ENDTOKEN
When it’s the end of this game that we play? ENDTOKEN
Will we crumble into the dust, my friend ENDTOKEN
Or will we start this game over again? ENDTOKEN
It's coming back to me ENDTOKEN
The young man lies alone ENDTOKEN
But fastened into the ground ENDTOKEN
The sound of fleeing feet and the cryin' eye ENDTOKEN
Will be his last sound ENDTOKEN
But do we gain from all this? ENDTOKEN
Now, was it worth a life? No ENDTOKEN
We throw all of our hopes away ENDTOKEN
And set our dreams aside ENDTOKEN
Now we’re crying ENDTOKEN
What will we do, what will we say ENDTOKEN
When it’s the end of this game that we play? ENDTOKEN
Will we crumble into the dust, my friend ENDTOKEN
Or will we start this game over again? ENDTOKEN
It's coming back to me ENDTOKEN
It’s coming back to me ENDTOKEN
It’s coming back to me ENDTOKEN
What will we do, what will we say ENDTOKEN
When it’s the end of this game that we play? ENDTOKEN
Will we crumble into the dust, my friend ENDTOKEN
Or will we start this game over again? ENDTOKEN
It's coming back to me ENDTOKEN
I lie awake on a long dark night ENDTOKEN
I can't seem to tame my mind ENDTOKEN
Slings and arrows are killing me inside ENDTOKEN
Maybe I can't accept the life that's mine ENDTOKEN
No, maybe I can't accept the life that's mine ENDTOKEN
Simple living is my desperate cry ENDTOKEN
Been trading love with indifference ENDTOKEN
And, yeah, it suits me just fine ENDTOKEN
I try to hold on but I'm calloused to the bone ENDTOKEN
Maybe that's why I feel alone, yeah ENDTOKEN
Maybe that's why I feel so alone ENDTOKEN
Because me, I'm rusted and weathered ENDTOKEN
Barely holding together ENDTOKEN
I'm covered with skin that peels ENDTOKEN
And it just won't heal ENDTOKEN
I am rusted and weathered ENDTOKEN
Barely holding together ENDTOKEN
I'm covered with skin that peels ENDTOKEN
And it just won't heal ENDTOKEN
No, it just won't heal, no, no, no ENDTOKEN
The sun shines and I can't avoid the light ENDTOKEN
I think I'm holding on to life too tight ENDTOKEN
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust ENDTOKEN
Sometimes I feel like giving up, yeah ENDTOKEN
I said, sometimes I feel like giving up ENDTOKEN
Because me, I'm rusted and weathered ENDTOKEN
Barely holdin' together ENDTOKEN
I'm covered with skin that peels ENDTOKEN
And it just won't heal ENDTOKEN
I am rusted and weathered ENDTOKEN
Barely holding together ENDTOKEN
I'm covered with skin that peels ENDTOKEN
And it just won't heal ENDTOKEN
It just won't heal, no ENDTOKEN
The day reminds me of you ENDTOKEN
The night hides your truth ENDTOKEN
The earth is a voice ENDTOKEN
Speaking to you ENDTOKEN
Take all this pride ENDTOKEN
And leave it behind ENDTOKEN
Because one day it ends ENDTOKEN
One day we die ENDTOKEN
Believe what you will ENDTOKEN
That is your right ENDTOKEN
But I choose to win ENDTOKEN
I choose to fight, to fight ENDTOKEN
Covered with skin that peels ENDTOKEN
And it just won't ENDTOKEN
Covered with skin that peels ENDTOKEN
And it just won't heal ENDTOKEN
They blazed a trail I dared to run ENDTOKEN
They built this world and I have come ENDTOKEN
I need another, like a brother ENDTOKEN
For a cryin' shoulder ENDTOKEN
This could be the last time ENDTOKEN
You will stand by my side ENDTOKEN
I can feel my soul, it’s bleeding ENDTOKEN
Will you fly with me this evening? ENDTOKEN
Sober mind, time now is gone ENDTOKEN
They carved my body not of stone ENDTOKEN
A pretty maze of emptiness ENDTOKEN
I said, "To hell with all the rest" ENDTOKEN
This could be the last time ENDTOKEN
You will stand by my side ENDTOKEN
I can feel my soul, it’s bleeding ENDTOKEN
Will you fly with me this evening? ENDTOKEN
This could be the last time ENDTOKEN
You will stand by my side ENDTOKEN
I can feel my soul, it’s bleeding ENDTOKEN
Will you fly with me this evening? ENDTOKEN
This could be the last time ENDTOKEN
You will stand by my side ENDTOKEN
I can feel my soul, it’s bleeding ENDTOKEN
Will you fly with me this evening? ENDTOKEN
What makes you touch? ENDTOKEN
What makes you feel? ENDTOKEN
What makes you stop and smell the roses in an open field? ENDTOKEN
What makes you unclean ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah [x6] ENDTOKEN
What makes you laugh? ENDTOKEN
What makes you cry? ENDTOKEN
What makes our youth run ENDTOKEN
From the thought that we might die? ENDTOKEN
What makes you bleed? ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah [x4] ENDTOKEN
Somebody told me the wrong way ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah [x7] ENDTOKEN
Somebody told me the wrong way ENDTOKEN
What if I died? ENDTOKEN
What did I give? ENDTOKEN
I hope it was an answer so you might live ENDTOKEN
I hope I helped you live[x4] ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah [x7] ENDTOKEN
Somebody told me the wrong way ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah [x7] ENDTOKEN
Somebody told me the wrong way ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah [x7] ENDTOKEN
I savor every minute that you're here ENDTOKEN
That you're here with me ENDTOKEN
Close my eyes and remember every breath ENDTOKEN
Every memory ENDTOKEN
Through all these sleepless nights alone ENDTOKEN
I still feel you ENDTOKEN
Across these miles away from home ENDTOKEN
That I'll never get used to ENDTOKEN
Every time you go, you take a part of me ENDTOKEN
A part of me with you ENDTOKEN
Every time you go ENDTOKEN
I feel it in my soul ENDTOKEN
Every, every ENDTOKEN
Every time you go, I'm half what I used to be ENDTOKEN
When you were in my arms ENDTOKEN
Every time you go ENDTOKEN
You take a part of me, a part of me with you ENDTOKEN
Every time you go ENDTOKEN
I count the days until you're back again ENDTOKEN
Back here by my side ENDTOKEN
When we're apart it feels like, something in me ENDTOKEN
Something in me dies ENDTOKEN
I hear your voice over the phone ENDTOKEN
And God I miss you ENDTOKEN
Still all these miles away from home ENDTOKEN
That I'll never get used to ENDTOKEN
Every time you go, you take a part of me ENDTOKEN
A part of me with you ENDTOKEN
Every time you go ENDTOKEN
I feel it in my soul ENDTOKEN
Every, every ENDTOKEN
Every time you go, I'm half what I used to be ENDTOKEN
When you were in my arms ENDTOKEN
Every time you go ENDTOKEN
You take a part of me, a part of me with you ENDTOKEN
Every time you go ENDTOKEN
Oh I'm there with you in your heart ENDTOKEN
No matter how far apart we are ENDTOKEN
Go with me, everywhere you go ENDTOKEN
Every time you go, you take a part of me ENDTOKEN
A part of me with you ENDTOKEN
Every time you go ENDTOKEN
I feel it in my soul ENDTOKEN
Every time you go, you take a part of me ENDTOKEN
A part of me with you ENDTOKEN
Every time you go ENDTOKEN
I feel it in my soul ENDTOKEN
Every, every ENDTOKEN
Every time you go, I'm half what I used to be ENDTOKEN
When you were in my arms ENDTOKEN
Every time you go ENDTOKEN
You take a part of me, a part of me with you ENDTOKEN
Every time you go ENDTOKEN
Every time you go ENDTOKEN
Every, every ENDTOKEN
Every time you go, I'm half what I used to be ENDTOKEN
You were in my arms ENDTOKEN
Every time you go ENDTOKEN
You take a part of me, a part of me with you ENDTOKEN
Well, you can dig me up a grave ENDTOKEN
And try and stick me in the ground ENDTOKEN
Well, you can tie me to the bed ENDTOKEN
And try and beat me half to death ENDTOKEN
But you can never keep me down ENDTOKEN
Well, you can stick me in a hole ENDTOKEN
And you can pray all day for rain ENDTOKEN
You can shoot me in the leg ENDTOKEN
Just to try to make me beg ENDTOKEN
And you can leave me there for days ENDTOKEN
And I'll stay alive ENDTOKEN
Just to follow you home, yeah ENDTOKEN
And I will survive ENDTOKEN
'Cause you're my Mississippi Princess, you're my California Queen ENDTOKEN
Like the Duchess of Detroit and every city in between ENDTOKEN
You can slap me in the face and you can scream profanity ENDTOKEN
Leave me here to die alone, but I'll still follow you home ENDTOKEN
I'll still follow you home ENDTOKEN
You can make a couple calls ENDTOKEN
And tell your brothers I'm in town ENDTOKEN
Put a bounty on my head ENDTOKEN
And tell my parents that I'm dead ENDTOKEN
And hope to hell I'm never found ENDTOKEN
You can steal me the keys ENDTOKEN
To your daddy's Cadillac ENDTOKEN
Well, you can tamper with the brakes ENDTOKEN
Call it a mistake ENDTOKEN
And pray I'm never coming back ENDTOKEN
And I'll stay alive ENDTOKEN
Just to follow you home, yeah ENDTOKEN
And I will survive ENDTOKEN
'Cause you're my Mississippi Princess, you're my California Queen ENDTOKEN
Like the Duchess of Detroit and every city in between ENDTOKEN
You can slap me in the face and you can scream profanity ENDTOKEN
Leave me here to die alone, but I'll still follow you home ENDTOKEN
I'll still follow you home ENDTOKEN
You can dig me up a grave ENDTOKEN
And try and stick me in the ground ENDTOKEN
You can tie me to the bed ENDTOKEN
And try and beat me half to death ENDTOKEN
But you can never keep me down ENDTOKEN
And I will survive ENDTOKEN
Cause you're my Mississippi Princess, you're my California Queen ENDTOKEN
Like the Duchess of Detroit and every city in between ENDTOKEN
You can slap me in the face and you can scream profanity ENDTOKEN
Leave me here to die alone, but I'll still follow you home ENDTOKEN
I'll still follow you home (I'll still follow you home) ENDTOKEN
I'll still follow you home (I'll still follow you home) ENDTOKEN
I'll still follow you home (I'll still follow you home) ENDTOKEN
I'll still follow you home (I'll still follow you home) ENDTOKEN
I'll still follow you home ENDTOKEN
When I'm all alone ENDTOKEN
And no one else is there ENDTOKEN
Waiting by the phone ENDTOKEN
To remind me ENDTOKEN
I'm still here ENDTOKEN
When shadows paint the scenes ENDTOKEN
Where spotlights used to fall ENDTOKEN
And I'm left wondering ENDTOKEN
Is it really worth it all? ENDTOKEN
There's a peace inside us all ENDTOKEN
Let it be your friend ENDTOKEN
It will help you carry on In the end ENDTOKEN
There's a peace inside us all ENDTOKEN
Life can hold you down ENDTOKEN
When you're not looking up ENDTOKEN
Can't you hear the sounds? ENDTOKEN
Hearts beating out loud ENDTOKEN
Although the names change ENDTOKEN
Inside we're all the same ENDTOKEN
Why can't we tear down these walls? ENDTOKEN
And show the scars we're covering ENDTOKEN
There's a peace ENDTOKEN
Oh there's a peace inside us all ENDTOKEN
Let it be... Oh, I said let it be, let it be your friend ENDTOKEN
There's a peace inside us all ENDTOKEN
Let it be your friend ENDTOKEN
It will help you carry on In the End ENDTOKEN
There's a peace inside us all ENDTOKEN
There's a peace, inside us all, Inside us all ENDTOKEN
Let it be, Let it be, Let it be [x7] ENDTOKEN
Let it be your friend ENDTOKEN
A few pictures, two tickets, from a trip we took last year ENDTOKEN
A handful of memories, some still seem clear ENDTOKEN
A few regrets, a couple of melodies, that remind me of you ENDTOKEN
I could say that I won't miss this, but that wouldn't be the truth ENDTOKEN
There's no one here to blame, and this is the only way ENDTOKEN
There's nothing left for us, to say ENDTOKEN
It's time to let you go, it's what we have to do ENDTOKEN
It's time to give this up, I think that we both knew ENDTOKEN
There's nothing left to say, there's nothing left to prove ENDTOKEN
And now it's time to turn and walk away from ENDTOKEN
What's left of me and you ENDTOKEN
What's left of me and you ENDTOKEN
Box of letters, that old t-shirt, still brings me back to you ENDTOKEN
A few more hours in the day, not sure what I should do ENDTOKEN
There's no one here to blame, and this is the only way ENDTOKEN
There's nothing left for us to say ENDTOKEN
It's time to let you go, it's what we have to do ENDTOKEN
It's time to give this up, I think that we both knew ENDTOKEN
There's nothing left to say, there's nothing left to prove ENDTOKEN
And now it's time to turn and walk away from ENDTOKEN
What's left of me and you ENDTOKEN
What's left of me and you ENDTOKEN
You were the best thing I'll ever give up ENDTOKEN
And it's hard to see the truth ENDTOKEN
When you think you're still in love ENDTOKEN
The only way to get on with my life ENDTOKEN
Is to say goodbye, so goodbye ENDTOKEN
It's time to let you go, it's what we have to do ENDTOKEN
It's time to give this up, I think that we both knew ENDTOKEN
There's nothing left to say, there's nothing left to prove ENDTOKEN
And now it's time to turn and walk away from ENDTOKEN
What's left of me and you ENDTOKEN
What's left of me and you ENDTOKEN
A few pictures, two tickets ENDTOKEN
From a trip we took last year ENDTOKEN
A handful of memories ENDTOKEN
Some still seem clear ENDTOKEN
Hands on the mirror, can't get much clearer ENDTOKEN
Can't make this all go away ENDTOKEN
Now that you're bleeding, you stare at the ceiling ENDTOKEN
Watch as it all fades away ENDTOKEN
From what you do, because of you ENDTOKEN
You know I can't be there ENDTOKEN
Each time that you call ENDTOKEN
I swore not to come, but I'm here after all ENDTOKEN
I know by the look that I see in your eye ENDTOKEN
I won't stand around and I won't watch you die ENDTOKEN
From what you do, because of you ENDTOKEN
What you do, what you do ENDTOKEN
What's become of you? ENDTOKEN
What you do, what you do ENDTOKEN
What's become of? ENDTOKEN
Now that you did this, you ask for forgiveness ENDTOKEN
Doctor, could you be my priest? ENDTOKEN
You say you're mistaken, but look what you've taken ENDTOKEN
You laugh as you lie through your teeth ENDTOKEN
From what you do, because of you ENDTOKEN
You know I can't be there ENDTOKEN
Each time that you call ENDTOKEN
I swore not to come, but I'm here after all ENDTOKEN
I know by the look that I see in your eye ENDTOKEN
I won't stand around and I won't watch you die ENDTOKEN
From what you do, because of you ENDTOKEN
What you do, what you do ENDTOKEN
What's become of you? ENDTOKEN
What you do, what you do ENDTOKEN
What's become of? ENDTOKEN
From what you do ENDTOKEN
Hands on the mirror, can't get much clearer ENDTOKEN
Can't make this all go away ENDTOKEN
Now that you're bleeding, you stare at the ceiling ENDTOKEN
Watch as it all fades away ENDTOKEN
What you do, what you do ENDTOKEN
What's become of you? ENDTOKEN
From what you do, because of you ENDTOKEN
You know I can't be there ENDTOKEN
Each time that you call ENDTOKEN
I swore not to come, but I'm here after all ENDTOKEN
I know by the look that I see in your eye ENDTOKEN
I won't stand around and I won't watch you die ENDTOKEN
From what you do, because of you ENDTOKEN
What you do, what you do ENDTOKEN
What's become of you? ENDTOKEN
What you do, what you do ENDTOKEN
What's become of? ENDTOKEN
Can you help me out, can you lend me a hand? ENDTOKEN
It's safe to say that I'm stuck again ENDTOKEN
Trapped between this life and the light ENDTOKEN
I just can't figure out, how to make it right ENDTOKEN
A thousand times before ENDTOKEN
I've wondered if there's something more, something more ENDTOKEN
I feel it's going to rain like this for days ENDTOKEN
So let it rain down and wash everything away ENDTOKEN
I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine ENDTOKEN
With every tomorrow comes another life ENDTOKEN
I feel it's going to rain, for days and days ENDTOKEN
(I feel it's going to rain) ENDTOKEN
I tried to figure out, I can't understand ENDTOKEN
What it means to be whole again ENDTOKEN
Trapped between the truth and the consequence ENDTOKEN
Nothing's real, nothing's making sense ENDTOKEN
A thousand times before ENDTOKEN
I've wondered if there's something more, something more ENDTOKEN
I feel it's going to rain like this for days ENDTOKEN
So let it rain down and wash everything away ENDTOKEN
I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine ENDTOKEN
I feel it's going to rain like this, rain like this, rain like this ENDTOKEN
Fall down, wash away my yesterdays ENDTOKEN
Fall down, so let the rain fall down on me ENDTOKEN
I feel it's going to rain like this for days ENDTOKEN
So let it rain down and wash everything away ENDTOKEN
I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine ENDTOKEN
I feel it's going to rain like this, rain like this ENDTOKEN
So let the rain fall ENDTOKEN
I feel it's going to rain like this rain like this ENDTOKEN
So let the rain fall down ENDTOKEN
I feel it's going to rain like this ENDTOKEN
I feel it's going to rain ENDTOKEN
Climb into the ring for a battle that you can't win ENDTOKEN
Swing as hard as you can swing, it will still mean nothing ENDTOKEN
Should’ve seen it coming, it had to happen sometime ENDTOKEN
But you went and brought a knife to an all out gun fight ENDTOKEN
And the only thing to save is the banner that you wave ENDTOKEN
To be wrapped around your grave ENDTOKEN
You’ve gone too far ENDTOKEN
Who do you think you are? ENDTOKEN
Is this what you came for? ENDTOKEN
Well, this means war ENDTOKEN
Say anything you want, but talk will get you nowhere ENDTOKEN
The only thing you've brought was psychological warfare ENDTOKEN
Well, there’s no getting out ENDTOKEN
And now you gotta wonder ENDTOKEN
Who will dig you out when you’re six feet under? ENDTOKEN
And the only thing to save is the banner that you wave ENDTOKEN
To be wrapped around your grave ENDTOKEN
You’ve gone too far ENDTOKEN
Who do you think you are? ENDTOKEN
Is this what you came for? ENDTOKEN
Well, this means war ENDTOKEN
And the only thing to save is the banner that you wave ENDTOKEN
To be wrapped around your grave ENDTOKEN
You’ve gone too far ENDTOKEN
Who do you think you are? ENDTOKEN
Is this what you came for? ENDTOKEN
Well, this means war ENDTOKEN
Well, this means war ENDTOKEN
Oh, I didn't mean to yell ENDTOKEN
But sometimes I get beside myself ENDTOKEN
And oh, I didn't mean to rush you ENDTOKEN
But time keeps pushing so much ENDTOKEN
Oh, time keeps pushing so much ENDTOKEN
Your eyes stare at me in the dark ENDTOKEN
And I hope those eyes ENDTOKEN
Don't steal my freedom ENDTOKEN
My freedom ENDTOKEN
Oh, If I didn't give it all ENDTOKEN
When I stood you made me crawl ENDTOKEN
And oh, if you never heard the song ENDTOKEN
Then I could still hide down behind the wall ENDTOKEN
Then I could still hide down behind the wall ENDTOKEN
Your eyes stare at me in the dark ENDTOKEN
And I hope those eyes ENDTOKEN
Don't steal my freedom ENDTOKEN
My freedom ENDTOKEN
Your eyes stare at me in the dark ENDTOKEN
And I hope those eyes ENDTOKEN
Don't steal my freedom ENDTOKEN
My freedom ENDTOKEN
Oh, my freedom ENDTOKEN
Sad eyes ENDTOKEN
Those eyes ENDTOKEN
Said don't steal my freedom ENDTOKEN
Your eyes stare at me in the dark ENDTOKEN
And I hope those eyes ENDTOKEN
Don't steal my freedom ENDTOKEN
My freedom ENDTOKEN
Your eyes stare at me in the dark ENDTOKEN
And I hope those eyes ENDTOKEN
Don't steal my freedom ENDTOKEN
My freedom ENDTOKEN
Oh, my freedom ENDTOKEN
Sad eyes ENDTOKEN
Those eyes ENDTOKEN
Sad eyes ENDTOKEN
Those eyes ENDTOKEN
Said don't steal my freedom ENDTOKEN
I've dreamed about this, sixteen days away ENDTOKEN
Now you're here, and my head lays ENDTOKEN
Beside your body, pillowed under mine ENDTOKEN
You were poison, spinning 'round my mind ENDTOKEN
"Welcome to my world" she said ENDTOKEN
"Do you feel alive?" she said ENDTOKEN
It's all a bad dream spinning in your lonely head ENDTOKEN
"Welcome to my world" she said ENDTOKEN
Separated world, she stayed separated ENDTOKEN
Down poison, down poison ENDTOKEN
Body withered, body died ENDTOKEN
Time to take away this life ENDTOKEN
Bad enough to die from one, not to mention four or five ENDTOKEN
"Welcome to my world" she said ENDTOKEN
"Do you feel alive?" she said ENDTOKEN
It's all a bad dream spinning in your lonely head ENDTOKEN
"Welcome to my world" she said ENDTOKEN
Separated world, she stayed separated ENDTOKEN
Down poison, down poison ENDTOKEN
(Down poison) You weren't there for me, I was there for you ENDTOKEN
(Down poison) You weren't there for me, I was there for you ENDTOKEN
(Down poison) You weren't there for me, I was there for you ENDTOKEN
(Down poison) You weren't there for me, never there for me ENDTOKEN
(Down poison) You wouldn't die for me, I've already died for you ENDTOKEN
(Down poison) You wouldn't die for me, I've already died for you ENDTOKEN
(Down poison) You wouldn't die for me, I've already died for you ENDTOKEN
(Down) You wouldn't die, you wouldn't die, you wouldn't die, no! ENDTOKEN
"Welcome to my world" she said ENDTOKEN
"Do you feel alive?" she said ENDTOKEN
It's all a bad dream spinning in your lonely head ENDTOKEN
"Welcome to my world" she said ENDTOKEN
Separated world, she stayed separated ENDTOKEN
Down poison, down poison ENDTOKEN
Down poison, down poison, down ENDTOKEN
I don't mind what you do to me ENDTOKEN
I don't mind what I cannot see ENDTOKEN
If you care, you will stay with me ENDTOKEN
If you dare, you will set me free ENDTOKEN
If you let me try, I will let you see again ENDTOKEN
If I let you die, you will let me sleep again ENDTOKEN
Would you sell your soul for a game you like to play? ENDTOKEN
If you let me go, I will burn your heart away ENDTOKEN
Well, you're here when you should be gone ENDTOKEN
And my heart, well, its turned to stone ENDTOKEN
If I'm dead by the time you find out just why I'm gone ENDTOKEN
Just say goodbye ENDTOKEN
If you let me try, I will let you see again ENDTOKEN
If I let you die, you will let me sleep again ENDTOKEN
Would you sell your soul for a game you like to play? ENDTOKEN
If you let me go, I will burn your heart away ENDTOKEN
Beyond the boundaries of your city's lights ENDTOKEN
Stand the heroes waiting for your cries ENDTOKEN
So many times you did not bring this on yourself ENDTOKEN
When that moment finally comes ENDTOKEN
I'll be there to help ENDTOKEN
On that day when you need ENDTOKEN
Your brothers and sisters to care ENDTOKEN
I'll be right here ENDTOKEN
Citizen soldiers ENDTOKEN
Holding the light for the ones that we guide ENDTOKEN
From the dark of despair ENDTOKEN
Standing on guard for the ones that we sheltered ENDTOKEN
We'll always be ready ENDTOKEN
Because we will always be there ENDTOKEN
When there are people crying in the streets ENDTOKEN
When they're starving for a meal to eat ENDTOKEN
When they simply need a place to make their beds ENDTOKEN
Right here underneath my wing ENDTOKEN
You can rest your head ENDTOKEN
On that day when you need ENDTOKEN
Your brothers and sisters to care ENDTOKEN
I'll be right here ENDTOKEN
Citizen soldiers ENDTOKEN
Holding the light for the ones that we guide ENDTOKEN
From the dark of despair ENDTOKEN
Standing on guard for the ones that we sheltered ENDTOKEN
We'll always be ready ENDTOKEN
Because we will always be there ENDTOKEN
There... there... there... ENDTOKEN
Hope and pray that you'll never need me ENDTOKEN
But rest assured I will not let you down ENDTOKEN
I'll walk beside you but you may not see me ENDTOKEN
The strongest among you may not wear a crown ENDTOKEN
On that day when you need ENDTOKEN
Your brothers and sisters to care ENDTOKEN
I'll be right here ENDTOKEN
On that day when you don't have the strength ENDTOKEN
For the burden you bear ENDTOKEN
I'll be right here ENDTOKEN
Citizen soldiers ENDTOKEN
Holding the light for the ones that we guide ENDTOKEN
From the dark of despair ENDTOKEN
Standing on guard for the ones that we sheltered ENDTOKEN
We'll always be ready ENDTOKEN
Because we will always be there ENDTOKEN
Unsure of yourself, you stand divided now ENDTOKEN
Which road will lead you there ENDTOKEN
Last time you fell and you hit hard ENDTOKEN
Your wounds have healed by now ENDTOKEN
But you still see your scars, yeah ENDTOKEN
But it’s not the way it used to be right now ENDTOKEN
You come so far to just let this go my friend, don't go out ENDTOKEN
The same way you did the last time ENDTOKEN
You’ll break when you fall ENDTOKEN
Don’t make the same mistakes you did all over ENDTOKEN
You’ve got to believe in yourself this time ENDTOKEN
Live on, live it up today ENDTOKEN
This life’s your cup ENDTOKEN
So drink it up I say, yeah ENDTOKEN
Say it’s mine so give it all up to me now ENDTOKEN
And walk that line, don’t let this go, don’t go out ENDTOKEN
Life’s your cup, life’s your cup ENDTOKEN
Drink it up ENDTOKEN
Life’s your cup, life’s your cup ENDTOKEN
One more time and I will go (and I will go) ENDTOKEN
It seems that we always assume it's right ENDTOKEN
I choose to wait and find ENDTOKEN
Whenever truth is not enough (is not enough) ENDTOKEN
We're seeking time to break free from lorn ENDTOKEN
I guess we're too far gone ENDTOKEN
Seems it's right to finally start (to finally start) ENDTOKEN
Change all the lines that held us down ENDTOKEN
We'll try to gain new ground ENDTOKEN
When living in peace is not enough (is not enough) ENDTOKEN
Look at the tides that made us strong ENDTOKEN
I guess we're too far gone ENDTOKEN
There's another world inside of me that you may never see ENDTOKEN
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide ENDTOKEN
But somewhere in this darkness ENDTOKEN
There's a light that I can't find ENDTOKEN
Well maybe it's too far away, yeah ENDTOKEN
Or maybe I'm just blind ENDTOKEN
Or maybe I'm just blind ENDTOKEN
So hold me when I'm here ENDTOKEN
Right me when I'm wrong ENDTOKEN
Hold me when I'm scared ENDTOKEN
And love me when I'm gone ENDTOKEN
Everything I am and everything in me ENDTOKEN
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be ENDTOKEN
I'd never let you down ENDTOKEN
Even if I could ENDTOKEN
I'd give up everything ENDTOKEN
If only for your good ENDTOKEN
So hold me when I'm here ENDTOKEN
Right me when I'm wrong ENDTOKEN
You can hold me when I'm scared ENDTOKEN
You won't always be there ENDTOKEN
So love me when I'm gone ENDTOKEN
Love me when I'm gone ENDTOKEN
When your education x-ray ENDTOKEN
Cannot see under my skin ENDTOKEN
I won't tell you a damn thing ENDTOKEN
That I could not tell my friends ENDTOKEN
Roaming through this darkness ENDTOKEN
I'm alive, but I'm alone ENDTOKEN
And part of me is fighting this ENDTOKEN
But part of me is gone ENDTOKEN
So hold me when I'm here ENDTOKEN
Right me when I'm wrong ENDTOKEN
Hold me when I'm scared ENDTOKEN
And love me when I'm gone ENDTOKEN

Affirmative may be justified ENDTOKEN
Take from one, give to another ENDTOKEN
The goal is to be unified ENDTOKEN
Take my hand, be my brother ENDTOKEN
The payment silenced the masses ENDTOKEN
Sanctified by oppression ENDTOKEN
Unity took a back seat ENDTOKEN
Sliding further into regression ENDTOKEN
One, oh, one, the only way is one ENDTOKEN
One, oh, one, the only way is one ENDTOKEN
I feel angry, I feel helpless ENDTOKEN
Want to change the world, yeah ENDTOKEN
I feel violent, I feel alone ENDTOKEN
Don't try and change my mind, no ENDTOKEN
Society, blind by color ENDTOKEN
Why hold down one to raise another? ENDTOKEN
Discrimination, now on both sides ENDTOKEN
Seeds of hate blossom further ENDTOKEN
The world is headed for mutiny ENDTOKEN
When all we want is unity ENDTOKEN
We may rise and fall ENDTOKEN
But in the end, we'll meet our fate again, oh ENDTOKEN
One, oh, one, the only way is one ENDTOKEN

Uncle Sam taught him to shoot, maybe a little too well ENDTOKEN

Mama, I just want you to know that I'm gonna be fine ENDTOKEN
Lord, I know it's the chance that I take ENDTOKEN
But I know you've forgiven the mistakes that I've made ENDTOKEN
There's a life out there and it's gonna be mine ENDTOKEN
Put me on a train mama ENDTOKEN
'Cause I can't take this pain no more ENDTOKEN
Put me on a train mama ENDTOKEN
I'm leavin' today ENDTOKEN
And there's a world that's out there waiting ENDTOKEN
And I know that it's the chance I'm taking ENDTOKEN
Put me on a train mama ENDTOKEN
I'm leavin' today ENDTOKEN
'Cause I got the fever, that's for sure ENDTOKEN
And knowin' I can get it makes me want it more ENDTOKEN

God knows how long I'll be gone ENDTOKEN
But maybe one day a train will bring me home ENDTOKEN
Put me on a train mama ENDTOKEN
Put me on a train mama ENDTOKEN
Oh, put me on a train mama ENDTOKEN
I'm leavin' today ENDTOKEN
'Cause I got the fever, that's for sure ENDTOKEN

But I know you've forgiven the mistakes that I've made ENDTOKEN
There's a life out there and it's gonna be mine ENDTOKEN
Oh, put me on the train ENDTOKEN
'Cause I'm leaving today ENDTOKEN
I'm in a bar full of bikers and a handful of junkies ENDTOKEN
It's a 50-50 chance that they're planning to jump me ENDTOKEN
Anybody drinking here is lucky just to leave here alive ENDTOKEN
Oh! Well, my favorite little waitress has a hold on my eye ENDTOKEN
But there's a shotgun loaded hidden under the bar ENDTOKEN
Her finger's on the trigger if anybody gets outta line ENDTOKEN
There's other places that are better to go ENDTOKEN
But I'm addicted to the red light show ENDTOKEN
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole ENDTOKEN
And I can't get enough of the things that she does ENDTOKEN
She's gonna be, my, midnight queen ENDTOKEN
(Lock 'n' load and I'm ready to go!) ENDTOKEN
She's gonna lick, my, pistol clean ENDTOKEN
(She's got a hold on me and ain't letting go) ENDTOKEN
And I can't get enough of the things that she does ENDTOKEN
Well, she walks like a model and she talks like a trucker ENDTOKEN
Doesn't want a lollipop, but she sure loves a sucker ENDTOKEN
They're closing in around her, I'm cutting to the front of the line ENDTOKEN
Oh! She's got a bottle of Tequila and a lime for her lips ENDTOKEN
Lay that body on the bar and put that salt on her hips ENDTOKEN
I was lying when I told her that I'm only gonna lick her tonight! ENDTOKEN
There's other places that are better to go ENDTOKEN
But I'm addicted to the red light show ENDTOKEN
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole ENDTOKEN
And I can't get enough of the things that she does ENDTOKEN
She's gonna be, my, midnight queen ENDTOKEN
(Lock 'n' load and I'm ready to go!) ENDTOKEN
She's gonna lick, my, pistol clean ENDTOKEN
(She's got a hold on me and ain't letting go) ENDTOKEN
She's gonna be, my, sex machine ENDTOKEN
(And I can never get her under control) ENDTOKEN
She's gonna climb all over me ENDTOKEN
(I'm like a pony in my own rodeo) ENDTOKEN
And I can't get enough of the things that she does ENDTOKEN
And I can't get enough of the things that she does ENDTOKEN
She's gonna be, my, midnight queen ENDTOKEN

Baby's born on a bathroom floor ENDTOKEN
Her mother prays that it'll never cry ENDTOKEN
But nothing's wrong, you've got your prom dress on ENDTOKEN
When they ask you'll say "It isn't mine" ENDTOKEN
You know they're gonna know you lied ENDTOKEN
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away? ENDTOKEN
You know they're gonna burn it down ENDTOKEN
Wash my hands of this ENDTOKEN
You notice how Dod ain't even helping you out ENDTOKEN
Wash my hands of this ENDTOKEN
You notice how God ain't even helping you ENDTOKEN
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away? ENDTOKEN
You know they're gonna burn it down ENDTOKEN
So keep the way you're feeling anonymous ENDTOKEN
And hide it all until the day you die ENDTOKEN
Your secrets safe, at least you thought it was ENDTOKEN
You can only keep it for a little while ENDTOKEN
And now you're terrified ENDTOKEN
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away? ENDTOKEN
You know they're gonna burn it down ENDTOKEN
Wash my hands of this ENDTOKEN
You notice how God ain't even helping you out ENDTOKEN
Wash my hands of this ENDTOKEN
You notice how God ain't even helping you ENDTOKEN
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away? ENDTOKEN
You know they're gonna burn it down ENDTOKEN
Baby's born on a bathroom floor ENDTOKEN
Her mother prays that it'll never cry ENDTOKEN
But nothing's wrong, you've got your prom dress on ENDTOKEN
When they ask you'll say "It isn't mine" ENDTOKEN
Damn you for thinking we would never know ENDTOKEN
And damn you for thinking we would never mind ENDTOKEN
Only reason that you made it this far ENDTOKEN
You never asked him, but you never tried ENDTOKEN
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away? ENDTOKEN
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away? ENDTOKEN
You know they're gonna burn it down ENDTOKEN
Wash my hands of this ENDTOKEN
You notice how God ain't even helping you out ENDTOKEN

Look at this photograph ENDTOKEN
Every time I do, it makes me laugh ENDTOKEN
How did our eyes get so red? ENDTOKEN
And what the hell is on Joey's head? ENDTOKEN
And this is where I grew up ENDTOKEN
I think the present owner fixed it up ENDTOKEN
I never knew we ever went without ENDTOKEN
The second floor is hard for sneaking out ENDTOKEN
And this is where I went to school ENDTOKEN
Most of the time had better things to do ENDTOKEN
Criminal record says I broke in twice ENDTOKEN
I must've done it half a dozen times ENDTOKEN
I wonder if it's too late ENDTOKEN
Should I go back and try to graduate? ENDTOKEN
Life's better now than it was back then ENDTOKEN
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in ENDTOKEN
Oh, oh, oh ENDTOKEN
Oh, God, I, I ENDTOKEN
Every memory of looking out the back door ENDTOKEN
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor ENDTOKEN
It's hard to say it, time to say it ENDTOKEN
Goodbye, goodbye ENDTOKEN
Every memory of walking out the front door ENDTOKEN
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for ENDTOKEN
It's hard to say it, time to say it ENDTOKEN
Goodbye, goodbye ENDTOKEN
(Goodbye) ENDTOKEN
Remember the old arcade? ENDTOKEN
Blew every dollar that we ever made ENDTOKEN
The cops hated us hangin' out ENDTOKEN
They say somebody went and burned it down ENDTOKEN
We used to listen to the radio ENDTOKEN
And sing along with every song we know ENDTOKEN
We said someday we'd find out how it feels ENDTOKEN
To sing to more than just the steering wheel ENDTOKEN
Kim's the first girl I kissed ENDTOKEN
I was so nervous that I nearly missed ENDTOKEN
She's had a couple of kids since then ENDTOKEN
I haven't seen her since God knows when ENDTOKEN
Oh, oh, oh ENDTOKEN
Oh, God, I, I ENDTOKEN
Every memory of looking out the back door ENDTOKEN
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor ENDTOKEN
It's hard to say it, time to say it ENDTOKEN
Goodbye, goodbye ENDTOKEN
Every memory of walking out the front door ENDTOKEN
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for ENDTOKEN
It's hard to say it, time to say it ENDTOKEN
Goodbye, goodbye ENDTOKEN
I miss that town ENDTOKEN
I miss their faces ENDTOKEN
You can't erase ENDTOKEN
You can't replace it ENDTOKEN
I miss it now ENDTOKEN
I can't believe it ENDTOKEN
So hard to stay ENDTOKEN
Too hard to leave it ENDTOKEN
If I could, I'd relive those days ENDTOKEN
I know the one thing that would never change ENDTOKEN
Every memory of looking out the back door ENDTOKEN
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor ENDTOKEN
It's hard to say it, time to say it ENDTOKEN
Goodbye, goodbye ENDTOKEN
Every memory of walking out the front door ENDTOKEN
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for ENDTOKEN
It's hard to say it, time to say it ENDTOKEN
Goodbye, goodbye ENDTOKEN
Look at this photograph ENDTOKEN
Every time I do, it makes me laugh ENDTOKEN
Every time I do, it makes me ENDTOKEN
The shades gone up ENDTOKEN
Mothers staring down ENDTOKEN
She don't know where he's been ENDTOKEN
Or how long he's been out ENDTOKEN
She said, "Boy, I'm tired of waiting up while you're out with your friends" ENDTOKEN
He said, "Mom, I'm trying and I'm living my life the best way that I can" ENDTOKEN
'Cause I'm trying to be somebody ENDTOKEN
I'm not trying to be somebody else ENDTOKEN
This life is mine I'm living ENDTOKEN
Don't you know me? I won't ever let you down ENDTOKEN
The day has come ENDTOKEN
The sun is moving on ENDTOKEN
She don't know where he'll go ENDTOKEN
Or when he's coming home ENDTOKEN
She said, "Son, take care, don't let your dreams get too far out of sight" ENDTOKEN
He said, "I love you. Now, don't worry about me, you know I'll be fine" ENDTOKEN
'Cause I'm trying to be somebody ENDTOKEN
I'm not trying to be somebody else ENDTOKEN
This life is mine I'm living ENDTOKEN
Don't you know me? I won't ever let you down ENDTOKEN
No ENDTOKEN
I'm not trying to be somebody else ENDTOKEN
Don't you know me? I won't ever let you ENDTOKEN
I won't ever let you ENDTOKEN
What they say ENDTOKEN
What they know ENDTOKEN
What they think won't ever bring me down ENDTOKEN
This life is mine ENDTOKEN
And I am my own ENDTOKEN
I'm trying to be somebody ENDTOKEN
I'm not trying to be somebody else ENDTOKEN
This life is mine I lead ENDTOKEN
Don't you know me? ENDTOKEN
I'm trying to be somebody ENDTOKEN

Oh, it must be nice ENDTOKEN
To spend each day in paradise ENDTOKEN
You wonder why you’ve never failed ENDTOKEN
Your life’s a fucking fairy tale ENDTOKEN
It feels like something got in the way ENDTOKEN
And maybe I had something to do with it ENDTOKEN
There's not much that i can say ENDTOKEN
But there sure is something I've got to prove to you ENDTOKEN
I told you, that I'd try ENDTOKEN
And you said that I lie ENDTOKEN
Like I have something to sell ENDTOKEN
Come on, wait a minute ENDTOKEN
You think I've been in this ENDTOKEN
For a little while ENDTOKEN
But now come on baby, please ENDTOKEN
I've been on my knees for a long time ENDTOKEN
So come on, give it to me ENDTOKEN
Just give it to me ENDTOKEN
There's always something I wanna say ENDTOKEN
But the words won't never come out ENDTOKEN
The way I want ENDTOKEN
Maybe I see another way ENDTOKEN
Or maybe I just see something you don't ENDTOKEN
These stories that you tell ENDTOKEN
Now I know them a little too well ENDTOKEN
You think I'll take what i want ENDTOKEN
Oh no ENDTOKEN
Come on, wait a minute ENDTOKEN
You think I've been in this for a little while ENDTOKEN
But now come on baby, please ENDTOKEN
I've been on my knees for a long time ENDTOKEN
Come on, give it to me ENDTOKEN
One more wrong will make it right ENDTOKEN
I don't wanna fight no more ENDTOKEN
I'm tired of saying please ENDTOKEN
This is all I need ENDTOKEN
So give me just a little bit ENDTOKEN
A little bit more ENDTOKEN
Oh, give me just a little bit more ENDTOKEN
Oooh ENDTOKEN

So give me just a little bit ENDTOKEN
A little bit more ENDTOKEN
Oh, give me just a little bit more ENDTOKEN
My hopes just fell, and I can't see ENDTOKEN
The reason why, why there is blood on my sleeve ENDTOKEN
And all this time, I thought it mine ENDTOKEN
But it's not, it's yours and ENDTOKEN
It's not worth it for me, gets harder every time call you ENDTOKEN
This life you lead, like us living in a shiny ballroom ENDTOKEN
Next time you bleed, right about this time tomorrow ENDTOKEN
Next time you steal, better ask before you borrow ENDTOKEN
And I don't see too well, don't sing too well ENDTOKEN
And so I settle to scream ENDTOKEN
Just grab your shit, and leave with it ENDTOKEN
They won't make no statues of you ENDTOKEN
It's not worth it for me, gets harder every time call you ENDTOKEN
This life you lead, like us living in a shiny ballroom ENDTOKEN
Next time you bleed, right about this time tomorrow ENDTOKEN
Next time you steal, better ask before you borrow ENDTOKEN
This label thief, find a better title suited for you ENDTOKEN
This tidal wave, is coming down upon you ENDTOKEN
This time I've forgotten ENDTOKEN
I swear this shit was rotten ENDTOKEN
This time, I believe it ENDTOKEN
'Cause I've seen the shit you're needing ENDTOKEN
It's not worth it for me, gets harder every time call you ENDTOKEN
This life you lead, like us living in a shiny ballroom ENDTOKEN
Next time you bleed, right about this time tomorrow ENDTOKEN
Next time you steal, better ask before you borrow ENDTOKEN
This label "thief", find a better title suited for you ENDTOKEN
This tidal wave, is coming down upon you ENDTOKEN
I kept up with the prophecy you spoke ENDTOKEN
I kept up with the message inside ENDTOKEN
Lost sight of the irony of twisted faith ENDTOKEN
Lost sight of my soul and it's void ENDTOKEN
Think I, think I'm unforgiven to this world ENDTOKEN
Think I, think I'm unforgiven to this world ENDTOKEN
Took a chance at deceiving myself ENDTOKEN
To share in the consequence of lies ENDTOKEN
Childish with my reasoning and pride ENDTOKEN
Godless to the extent that I died ENDTOKEN
Think I, think I'm unforgiven to this world ENDTOKEN
Think I, think I'm unforgiven to this world ENDTOKEN
Think I'm unforgiven ENDTOKEN
No more raging innocence[x4] ENDTOKEN
Step inside the light and see ENDTOKEN
The fear of God burn inside of me ENDTOKEN
The gold was put to flame, to kill ENDTOKEN
To burn, to mold it's purity ENDTOKEN
And if forever never comes then I ENDTOKEN
And if forever never comes then I ENDTOKEN
And if forever never comes then I ENDTOKEN
I’ll hold on and hold on ENDTOKEN
I keep listening to my chest ENDTOKEN
For a beat, but there’s nothing left ENDTOKEN
It’s been a week since I’ve seen you ENDTOKEN
And I still can’t believe it ENDTOKEN
'Cause I’m dying inside alone ENDTOKEN
And every day we got to be apart ENDTOKEN
I’m like a baby with a broken heart ENDTOKEN
But the second that I'll see you ENDTOKEN
You will know how much I need you ENDTOKEN
Because I’ll never be letting you go ENDTOKEN
(Well, you know I) ENDTOKEN
I’m lost without you ENDTOKEN
And there’s nothing I can do ENDTOKEN
You’re the one I can’t go without ENDTOKEN
If I ain't holding on to you then I'll be holding out forever ENDTOKEN
I’ve got you now and ENDTOKEN
I’m not letting go of you ENDTOKEN
Never be together long enough ENDTOKEN
'Cause every moment I’m with you ENDTOKEN
It’s like I’m holding on to heaven ENDTOKEN
And if forever never comes then I ENDTOKEN
And if forever never comes then I ENDTOKEN
And if forever never comes then I ENDTOKEN
I’ll hold on, hold on ENDTOKEN
And if I could write a symphony ENDTOKEN
Then baby, you would be my melody ENDTOKEN
And you would flow like a river ENDTOKEN
Slowly going on forever ENDTOKEN
Like a feather that’s blowing away ENDTOKEN
Like everyone that needs a fairy tale ENDTOKEN
Like every mother’s love that never fails ENDTOKEN
Like every game that needs a player ENDTOKEN
Every sinner needs a savior ENDTOKEN
I'm the villain you're willing to save ENDTOKEN
(Now you know why) ENDTOKEN
I’m lost without you ENDTOKEN
And there’s nothing I can do ENDTOKEN
You’re the one I can’t go without ENDTOKEN
If I ain't holding on to you then I'll be holding out forever ENDTOKEN
I’ve got you now and ENDTOKEN
I’m not letting go of you ENDTOKEN
Never be together long enough ENDTOKEN
'Cause every moment I’m with you ENDTOKEN
It’s like I’m holding on to heaven ENDTOKEN
And I’m willing to wait ENDTOKEN
Just to see you another day ENDTOKEN
What I’m waiting for ENDTOKEN
Will wash this pain away ENDTOKEN
And it’s never too late ENDTOKEN
(Never too late) ENDTOKEN
And if forever never comes then I ENDTOKEN
And if forever never comes then I ENDTOKEN
And if forever never comes then I ENDTOKEN
I’ll hold on and hold on ENDTOKEN
Now you know why ENDTOKEN
I’m lost without you ENDTOKEN
And there’s nothing I can do ENDTOKEN
You’re the one I can’t go without ENDTOKEN
If I ain't holding on to you then I'll be holding out forever ENDTOKEN
I’ve got you now and ENDTOKEN
I’m not letting go of you ENDTOKEN
Never be together long enough ENDTOKEN

On to me, to see, believe ENDTOKEN

Hey there little darling, where'd the old man gone? ENDTOKEN
Why don't we get out of town and do it all night long? ENDTOKEN
We can lie out in the field 'til the morning light ENDTOKEN
Then me and your old man are gonna have to fight ENDTOKEN
Start the loving in the truck and wind up in the ditch ENDTOKEN
Then the old man will come a runnin' with a hickory switch ENDTOKEN
Oh, no, gotta learn this some day ENDTOKEN
Why, I, gotta learn the hard way ENDTOKEN
Buddy showed me just how fast a car can go ENDTOKEN
I'll race you for your pink slip right before this show ENDTOKEN
Put your girlfriend in the bet to make things good ENDTOKEN
'Cause she's been staring at me like no girlfriend should ENDTOKEN
Bastards sitting right there on the starting line ENDTOKEN
Stuck the sugar in your gas tank by myself last night ENDTOKEN
Oh, no, gotta learn this some day ENDTOKEN
Why, I, gotta learn the hard way ENDTOKEN
Ooh, yeah ENDTOKEN
Hey there little darling, where'd the old man gone? ENDTOKEN

Do you ever think about running away? ENDTOKEN
'Cause I was thinkin' about leavin' today ENDTOKEN
We'll follow forever where our hearts wanna go ENDTOKEN
Maybe we'll live somewhere where nobody knows our names ENDTOKEN
Then things might change for the good ENDTOKEN
I wanna be somewhere so far away ENDTOKEN
To lie under the night at the end of another good day ENDTOKEN
I can't tell you how long we'll be gone ENDTOKEN
But as long as we're together, then forever is never too long ENDTOKEN
Too long, oh no ENDTOKEN
Do you ever think about not comin' back? ENDTOKEN
Hoppin' on a train and we'll burn up the tracks ENDTOKEN
We'll jump off somewhere that we don't know how to say ENDTOKEN
Maybe hitch a ride from someone who can tell us the way ENDTOKEN
To where these things might change for the good ENDTOKEN
I wanna be somewhere so far away ENDTOKEN
To lie under the night at the end of another good day ENDTOKEN
I can't tell you how long we'll be gone ENDTOKEN
But as long as we're together then forever is never too ENDTOKEN
Where forever is never too long ENDTOKEN
Not with you right here by me ENDTOKEN
Maybe, maybe we'll just see ENDTOKEN
Where this road will lead for us ENDTOKEN
I wanna be somewhere so far away ENDTOKEN
To lie under the night at the end of another good day ENDTOKEN
I can't tell you how long we'll be gone ENDTOKEN

He spends his nights in California ENDTOKEN
Watching the stars on the big screen ENDTOKEN
Then he lies awake and he wonders ENDTOKEN
"Why can’t that be me?" ENDTOKEN
'Cause in his life he's filled with all these good intentions ENDTOKEN
He’s left a lot of things he’d rather not mention right now ENDTOKEN
But just before he says goodnight ENDTOKEN
He looks up with a little smile at me and he says ENDTOKEN
If I could be like that ENDTOKEN
I would give anything ENDTOKEN
Just to live one day, in those shoes ENDTOKEN
If I could be like that ENDTOKEN
What would I do? ENDTOKEN
What would I do? ENDTOKEN
Now and dreams we run ENDTOKEN
She spends her days up in the north park ENDTOKEN
Watching the people as they pass ENDTOKEN
And all she wants is just a little piece of this dream ENDTOKEN
Is that too much to ask? ENDTOKEN
With a safe home, and a warm bed ENDTOKEN
On a quiet little street ENDTOKEN
All she wants is just that something to hold onto ENDTOKEN
That’s all she needs ENDTOKEN
Yeah ENDTOKEN
If I could be like that ENDTOKEN
I would give anything ENDTOKEN
Just to live one day, in those shoes ENDTOKEN
If I could be like that ENDTOKEN
What would I do? ENDTOKEN
What would I do? ENDTOKEN
I’m falling into the same dreams ENDTOKEN
We run away ENDTOKEN

Just to live one day, in those shoes ENDTOKEN
If I could be like that ENDTOKEN
What would I do? ENDTOKEN
What would I do? ENDTOKEN
Falling in ENDTOKEN
I feel I'm falling in, to this again ENDTOKEN
You must be happy with yourself ENDTOKEN
You think you're so much better than me ENDTOKEN
Why do you love to see me fail so much ENDTOKEN
'Cause on that day you crawl back on your knees ENDTOKEN
Tell me who will save you ENDTOKEN
When there's no one else around ENDTOKEN
And you can't turn to me ENDTOKEN
Tell me where will you be ENDTOKEN
When it's over ENDTOKEN
And all this pride you hold inside ENDTOKEN
Is gone ENDTOKEN
Tell me where will you hide ENDTOKEN
When it's over ENDTOKEN
And everything you know is said and done ENDTOKEN
When it's over, where will you run? ENDTOKEN
Do your memories haunt your dreams? ENDTOKEN
Do they simply seem to have a mind of their own? ENDTOKEN
Tell me what the emptiness brings ENDTOKEN
When everything you know is everything but gone ENDTOKEN
Tell me who will save you ENDTOKEN
When there's no one else around ENDTOKEN
And you can't turn to me ENDTOKEN
Tell me where will you be ENDTOKEN
When it's over ENDTOKEN
And all this pride you hold inside ENDTOKEN
Is gone ENDTOKEN
Tell me where will you hide ENDTOKEN
When it's over ENDTOKEN
And everything you know is said and done ENDTOKEN
When it's over, where will you run? ENDTOKEN
You can't hold your world together now ENDTOKEN
Everyone sees who you really are ENDTOKEN
When your castle crumbles at your feet ENDTOKEN
Don't you run to me ENDTOKEN
When it's over ENDTOKEN
And all this pride you hold inside is dying ENDTOKEN
Where will you hide? ENDTOKEN
When it's over ENDTOKEN
And all this pride you hold inside has died ENDTOKEN
Tell me where will you hide? ENDTOKEN
When it's over ENDTOKEN
And everything you know is said and done ENDTOKEN
When it's over, where will you run? ENDTOKEN
He spent his whole life being too young ENDTOKEN
To live the life that's in his dreams ENDTOKEN
At night he lies awake and he wonders ENDTOKEN
"Why can’t that be me?" ENDTOKEN
Cause in his life he's filled with all these good intentions ENDTOKEN
He’s left a lot of things he’d rather not mention right now ENDTOKEN
But just before he says goodnight ENDTOKEN
He looks up with a little smile at me and he says ENDTOKEN
If I could be like that ENDTOKEN
I would give anything ENDTOKEN
Just to live one day, in those shoes ENDTOKEN
If I could be like that ENDTOKEN
What would I do? ENDTOKEN
What would I do? ENDTOKEN
Now and dreams we run ENDTOKEN
She spends her days up in the north park ENDTOKEN
Watching the people as they pass ENDTOKEN
And all she wants is just a little piece of this dream ENDTOKEN
Is that too much to ask? ENDTOKEN
With a safe home, and a warm bed ENDTOKEN
On a quiet little street ENDTOKEN
All she wants is just that something to hold onto ENDTOKEN
That’s all she needs ENDTOKEN
Yeah ENDTOKEN
If I could be like that ENDTOKEN
I would give anything ENDTOKEN
Just to live one day, in those shoes ENDTOKEN
If I could be like that ENDTOKEN
What would I do? ENDTOKEN
What would I do? ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah ENDTOKEN
Falling into this ENDTOKEN
In dreams ENDTOKEN
We'll run away ENDTOKEN
If I could be like that ENDTOKEN
I would give anything ENDTOKEN
Just to live one day, in those shoes ENDTOKEN
If I could be like that ENDTOKEN
What would I do? ENDTOKEN
What would I do? ENDTOKEN
If I could be like that ENDTOKEN
I would give anything ENDTOKEN
Just to live one day, in those shoes ENDTOKEN
If I could be like that ENDTOKEN
What would I do? ENDTOKEN
Lord, what would I do? ENDTOKEN
Yeah, yeah ENDTOKEN
Falling in ENDTOKEN
I feel I'm falling into this...again ENDTOKEN
I’m walking a wire ENDTOKEN
Feels like a thousand ways I could fall ENDTOKEN
To want is to buy, but to live is to die ENDTOKEN
And you can’t take it all ENDTOKEN
When everything is said and done, I won’t have one thing left ENDTOKEN
What happened to everything that I've ever known? ENDTOKEN
'Cause all they gave me was this ticket to heaven ENDTOKEN
But that ticket to heaven said to lie in the bed that you make ENDTOKEN
Now I’m restless and I’m running from everything ENDTOKEN
I’m running from everything ENDTOKEN
I’m afraid it’s a little too late ENDTOKEN
Soft voices lie, innocents die ENDTOKEN
Now ain't that a shame? ENDTOKEN
And all your dreams ENDTOKEN
And all your money, they don’t mean a thing ENDTOKEN
When everything is said and done ENDTOKEN
You won’t have one thing left ENDTOKEN
What happened to everything that I've ever known? ENDTOKEN
'Cause all they gave me was this ticket to heaven ENDTOKEN
But that ticket to heaven said to lie in the bed that you make ENDTOKEN
Now I’m restless and I’m running from everything ENDTOKEN
I’m running from everything ENDTOKEN
I’m afraid it’s a little too late ENDTOKEN
It’s a little too late ENDTOKEN
All they gave me was this ticket to heaven ENDTOKEN
But that ticket to heaven said to lie in the bed that you make ENDTOKEN
Now I’m restless and I’m running from everything ENDTOKEN
I’m running from everything ENDTOKEN
I’m afraid it’s a little too late ENDTOKEN
All they gave me was this ticket to heaven ENDTOKEN
But that ticket to heaven said to lie in the bed that you make ENDTOKEN
Now I’m restless and I’m running from everything ENDTOKEN
I’m running from everything ENDTOKEN
I’m afraid it’s a little too late ENDTOKEN
If you say I'm alive I guess I'm living ENDTOKEN
Why should I guess your size, a choice I've been given ENDTOKEN
Tell me everything's fine and peace is coming ENDTOKEN
I won't listen to the heartache I'm numbing ENDTOKEN
When the world casts me down and says I've changed ENDTOKEN
I'll survive on all the promises you made to me ENDTOKEN
Guess there's no one to blame ENDTOKEN
When all you're living on is bread of shame ENDTOKEN
Bread of Shame ENDTOKEN
When the world says I've changed ENDTOKEN
Bread of shame ENDTOKEN
Just promise me fame I'll survive on the bread of shame ENDTOKEN
As long as you say I'm free ENDTOKEN
Then keep these chains off me ENDTOKEN
Tell me down is up ENDTOKEN
I'll let you fill this broken cup ENDTOKEN
When the world fall down ENDTOKEN
Let them fall on me ENDTOKEN
Because no one's around who believe me ENDTOKEN
Tell me where I sign my name ENDTOKEN
Inside I find no peace of mind to hide behind ENDTOKEN
Only bread of shame ENDTOKEN
I spent a day by the river ENDTOKEN
It was quiet and the wind stood still ENDTOKEN
I spent some time with nature ENDTOKEN
To remind me of all that's real ENDTOKEN
It's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone ENDTOKEN
And remember that you feel ENDTOKEN
I said it's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone ENDTOKEN
And remember that you feel ENDTOKEN
Again I stand, Lord I stand ENDTOKEN
Against the Faceless Man ENDTOKEN
Again I stand, Lord I stand ENDTOKEN
Against the Faceless Man ENDTOKEN
Now I saw a face on the water ENDTOKEN
It looked humble but willing to fight ENDTOKEN
I saw the will of a warrior ENDTOKEN
His yoke is easy and his burden is light ENDTOKEN
He looked me right in the eyes ENDTOKEN
Direct and concise to remind me ENDTOKEN
To always do what's right ENDTOKEN
He looked me right in the eyes ENDTOKEN
Direct and concise to remind me ENDTOKEN
To always do what's right ENDTOKEN
Again I stand, Lord I stand ENDTOKEN
Against the Faceless Man ENDTOKEN
Again I stand, Lord God I stand ENDTOKEN
Against the Faceless Man ENDTOKEN
Because if the face inside can't see the light ENDTOKEN
I know I'll have to walk alone ENDTOKEN
And if I walk alone to the other side ENDTOKEN
I know I might not make it home ENDTOKEN
Again I stand, Lord I stand ENDTOKEN
Against the Faceless Man ENDTOKEN
Again I stand, Lord I stand ENDTOKEN
Against the Faceless Man ENDTOKEN
Next time I see this face ENDTOKEN
I'll say I choose to live for always ENDTOKEN
So won't you come inside ENDTOKEN
And never go away ENDTOKEN
Next time I see this face ENDTOKEN
I'll say I choose to live for always ENDTOKEN
So won't you come inside ENDTOKEN
And never go away ENDTOKEN
Again I stand, Lord I stand ENDTOKEN
Against the Faceless Man ENDTOKEN
Again I stand, Lord I stand ENDTOKEN
Against the Faceless Man ENDTOKEN
Again I stand, Lord I stand ENDTOKEN
Against the Faceless Man ENDTOKEN
I'm back in my hometown ENDTOKEN
And Main Street's dying now ENDTOKEN
It's like there's nothing left of it ENDTOKEN
No more high school grounds ENDTOKEN
They tore that building down ENDTOKEN
And everything with it I miss ENDTOKEN
I call up my old friends ENDTOKEN
So lost since I've seen them ENDTOKEN
Feels like we're back there instantly to me ENDTOKEN
We'd all meet at Shawn's ENDTOKEN
The backyard fire's on ENDTOKEN
And we'd start telling tales of how life used to be ENDTOKEN
The years have come and gone ENDTOKEN
But these stories carry on ENDTOKEN
Looking back, they're better than they used to be ENDTOKEN
'Cause you should've seen the size of the guys we were fightin' ENDTOKEN
And we shouldn't be alive at the speeds we were driving ENDTOKEN
But Momma always taught us never to tell a lie ENDTOKEN
And every ten yard pass always turned into twenty ENDTOKEN
Every girl we were with never cost any money ENDTOKEN
And we drank more tequila than any man alive ENDTOKEN
And the story goes on, and gets a little better ENDTOKEN
Every time we're together ENDTOKEN
It's funny how we change ENDTOKEN
And some things stay the same ENDTOKEN
God, I miss the glory days, always ENDTOKEN
Daylight getting near ENDTOKEN
We shed a few more tears ENDTOKEN
Lord, I love the memories we've made ENDTOKEN
The years have come and gone ENDTOKEN
But the stories carry on ENDTOKEN
Looking back, they're better than they used to be ENDTOKEN
'Cause you should've seen the size of the guys we were fightin' ENDTOKEN
And we shouldn't be alive at the speeds we were driving ENDTOKEN
But Momma always taught us never to tell a lie ENDTOKEN
And every ten yard pass always turned into twenty ENDTOKEN
Every girl we were with never cost any money ENDTOKEN
And we drank more tequila than any man alive ENDTOKEN
And the story goes on, and gets a little better ENDTOKEN
Every time we're together ENDTOKEN
Well, you should've seen the size of the guys we were fightin' ENDTOKEN
And we shouldn't be alive at the speeds we were driving ENDTOKEN
But Momma always taught us never to tell a lie ENDTOKEN
And every ten yard pass always turned into twenty ENDTOKEN
Every girl we were with never cost any money ENDTOKEN
And we drank more tequila than any man alive ENDTOKEN
And the story goes on, and gets a little better ENDTOKEN
Every time we're together ENDTOKEN
And the story goes on, and gets a little better ENDTOKEN
Every time we're together ENDTOKEN
I'm through, thinking of things to say to you ENDTOKEN
It's true, I've said enough and so have you ENDTOKEN
Just drive, you slam the door and so do I ENDTOKEN
Tongue tied, from all the little things ENDTOKEN
And they're the reason that I scream ENDTOKEN
I needed you ENDTOKEN
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head ENDTOKEN
Was I mean to you? ENDTOKEN
Car keys in your hand ENDTOKEN
I believe that you would leave me for dead ENDTOKEN
Your turn, you'd rather leave then live and learn ENDTOKEN
That's why, you want an end and so do I ENDTOKEN
This time, I'll leave, and leave it all behind ENDTOKEN
Tongue tied, from all the little things ENDTOKEN
And they're the reason that I scream ENDTOKEN
I needed you ENDTOKEN
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head ENDTOKEN
Was I mean to you? ENDTOKEN
Car keys in your hand ENDTOKEN
I believe that you would leave me for dead ENDTOKEN
I needed you ENDTOKEN
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head ENDTOKEN
Was I mean to you? ENDTOKEN
Car keys in your hand ENDTOKEN
I believe that you would leave me for dead ENDTOKEN
I believe, you would leave, me for dead, me for dead ENDTOKEN
I believe, you would leave, me for dead, me for dead ENDTOKEN
I'm through, thinking of things to say to you ENDTOKEN
It's true, I've said enough and so have you ENDTOKEN
Just drive, you slam the door and so do I ENDTOKEN
Tongue tied, from all the little things ENDTOKEN
And they're the reason that I scream ENDTOKEN
I needed you ENDTOKEN
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head ENDTOKEN
Was I mean to you? ENDTOKEN
Car keys in your hand ENDTOKEN
I believe that you would leave me for dead ENDTOKEN
I needed you ENDTOKEN
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head ENDTOKEN
Was I mean to you? ENDTOKEN
Car keys in your hand ENDTOKEN
I believe that you would leave me for dead ENDTOKEN
I believe, you would leave, me for dead, me for dead ENDTOKEN
I believe, you would leave ENDTOKEN
I believe that you would leave me for... ENDTOKEN
I give my all my everything ENDTOKEN
Anything you want I've tried to be ENDTOKEN
I tried, god knows I tried ENDTOKEN
Or am I stuck somewhere between ENDTOKEN
Who I am and who I hope to be ENDTOKEN
Am I fighting the good fight ENDTOKEN
Keep pressing on ENDTOKEN
Fight the good fight ENDTOKEN
Fight, what you know is wrong ENDTOKEN
Keep pressing on ENDTOKEN
Fight the good fight ENDTOKEN
Fight, what you know is wrong ENDTOKEN
I've come so far to fall too fast ENDTOKEN
Eyes forward, I can't look back I try ENDTOKEN
God knows I try ENDTOKEN
I shift my eyes to the sky ENDTOKEN
In the distance see the horizon line ENDTOKEN
She waits for me ENDTOKEN
Fighting the good fight ENDTOKEN
I give my all my everything ENDTOKEN
Anything you want I strive to be ENDTOKEN
Am I stuck somewhere between ENDTOKEN
Who I am and who I hope to be ENDTOKEN
Fighting, I'm fighting ENDTOKEN
Fighting the good fight ENDTOKEN
Am I stuck somewhere in between ENDTOKEN
Who I am and who I hope to be ENDTOKEN
Remember that ENDTOKEN
Sometimes I fall in between ENDTOKEN
The nights blue moon and the shadows ENDTOKEN
Fight on, fight the good fight ENDTOKEN
What you know is wrong ENDTOKEN
I'll keep fighting ENDTOKEN
Fight on, keep fighting the good fight ENDTOKEN
Fight on, fight on ENDTOKEN
Rubber headed motor junky ENDTOKEN
Run me down and try to stone me ENDTOKEN
Throw my life away, and I’ll be worthless just like you ENDTOKEN
Somewhere now a baby’s crying ENDTOKEN
Down the road his mother’s dying ENDTOKEN
Shot a line and blew her mind, and now she’s turning blue ENDTOKEN
Don't you throw your life away ENDTOKEN
Just wait until another day ENDTOKEN
Don't you throw your life away ENDTOKEN
'Cause baby, I can feel it ENDTOKEN
Don't you ever compromise it ENDTOKEN
Don't you even realize it ENDTOKEN
Don't you throw your life away, 'cause baby, I can feel it now ENDTOKEN
Trip and fall ENDTOKEN
I'm sure you all can tell me ENDTOKEN
What is on the wall ENDTOKEN
Behind the liquor store where you get smacked up all the time ENDTOKEN
Perfect little life you wasted, overdosed and that death you tasted ENDTOKEN
Scared you back into yourself, now you walk the line ENDTOKEN
Don't you throw your life away ENDTOKEN
Just wait until another day ENDTOKEN
Don't you throw your life away ENDTOKEN
'Cause baby, I can feel it ENDTOKEN
Don't you ever compromise it ENDTOKEN
Don't you even realize it ENDTOKEN
Don't you throw your life away, 'cause baby, I can feel it now ENDTOKEN
Life away ENDTOKEN
Life away ENDTOKEN
Life away ENDTOKEN
I don't live anymore ENDTOKEN
I don't love me this way ENDTOKEN
I don't have wings to fly ENDTOKEN
I don't have, gone away ENDTOKEN
I don't have anything ENDTOKEN
I don't need a space to breathe ENDTOKEN
I don't hide in sanctity ENDTOKEN
I don't need what you need ENDTOKEN
I don't have, have a space to ENDTOKEN
I don't claim to know just why ENDTOKEN
I don't try to pacify ENDTOKEN
I don't love me just yet ENDTOKEN
I don't care, gone away ENDTOKEN
This ones mine ENDTOKEN
This ones mine ENDTOKEN
This ones mine ENDTOKEN
All mine ENDTOKEN
Not this time I won't deny ENDTOKEN
This one's mine ENDTOKEN
All this time ENDTOKEN
Not this time I won't deny ENDTOKEN
All this time, Yes it's mine ENDTOKEN
I don't have anything ENDTOKEN
I don't need the space to breathe ENDTOKEN
I don't hide in sanctity ENDTOKEN
I don't need what you need ENDTOKEN
I don't have I don't have ENDTOKEN
I don't have I don't have ENDTOKEN
I don't have anything ENDTOKEN
I don't need the space to breathe ENDTOKEN
I don't hide in sanctity ENDTOKEN
I don't need what you need ENDTOKEN
I don't have I don't have ENDTOKEN
I don't have I don't have ENDTOKEN
(Hey, hey) ENDTOKEN
She had her eyes on the prize as the girl next door ENDTOKEN
You grow up quick when you grow up poor ENDTOKEN
It's the only way to LA that she knows ENDTOKEN
The Hollywood pose: teeth, tits, and toes ENDTOKEN
It didn't take her long to leave the boulevard ENDTOKEN
So many Five Star friends with black credit cards ENDTOKEN
She'd try anything once ENDTOKEN
'Cause anything goes ENDTOKEN
It never comes easy when you're digging for gold ENDTOKEN
(Hey, hey) ENDTOKEN
Well, she ain't no Cinderella ENDTOKEN
When she's getting undressed ENDTOKEN
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west ENDTOKEN
Far too pretty to be giving it cheap ENDTOKEN
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week ENDTOKEN
Yeah, she'd even break a promise in the promise-land ENDTOKEN
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands ENDTOKEN
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can ENDTOKEN
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands ENDTOKEN
(Hey, hey) ENDTOKEN
I doubt she'd even let the devil buy her little black book ENDTOKEN
City Hall would probably fall off if anyone got a look ENDTOKEN
Every A-List player is her favorite friend ENDTOKEN
Since they all taste the same in the back of the Benz ENDTOKEN
A congressman would call her every once in a while ENDTOKEN
Got the school girl skirt on the top of the pile ENDTOKEN
She'd done everyone once and everyone knows ENDTOKEN
You gotta get a little dirty when you're digging for gold ENDTOKEN
(Hey, hey) ENDTOKEN
Well, she ain't no Cinderella ENDTOKEN
When she's getting undressed ENDTOKEN
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west ENDTOKEN
Far too pretty to be giving it cheap ENDTOKEN
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week ENDTOKEN
Yeah, she'd even break a promise in the promise-land ENDTOKEN
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands ENDTOKEN
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can ENDTOKEN
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands ENDTOKEN
Well, someone spilled the beans and now her name's in the press ENDTOKEN
Tough to keep it all a secret when you're one of the best ENDTOKEN
The judge is going easy 'cause he paid for her chest ENDTOKEN
Yeah, he loves his little naughty wicked witch of the west ENDTOKEN
Far too pretty to be giving it cheap ENDTOKEN
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week ENDTOKEN
Yeah, she'd even break a promise in the promise-land ENDTOKEN
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands ENDTOKEN
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can ENDTOKEN
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands ENDTOKEN
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can ENDTOKEN
She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands ENDTOKEN
Never mind the face that you put on in front of me ENDTOKEN
And never mind the pain you've put me through ENDTOKEN
'Cause every little thing you say ENDTOKEN
And every little thing you do ENDTOKEN
It makes me doubt all of this ENDTOKEN
What are you waiting for? ENDTOKEN
Look what you did ENDTOKEN
Is this who you wanted me to be? ENDTOKEN
Well, it's not me ENDTOKEN
Look what you did ENDTOKEN
Is this how you wanted it to be? ENDTOKEN
This life you gave away ENDTOKEN
Was meant for me ENDTOKEN
Forget about the trip that you've been on ENDTOKEN
Or so it seems ENDTOKEN
Never mind the lies that you told my tears ENDTOKEN
'Cause every little thing you said ENDTOKEN
And every little thing you did ENDTOKEN
You made me doubt all of this ENDTOKEN
Is that what you're waiting for? ENDTOKEN
Look what you did ENDTOKEN
Is this who you wanted me to be? ENDTOKEN
Well, it's not me ENDTOKEN
Look what you did ENDTOKEN
Is this how you wanted it to be? ENDTOKEN
This life you gave away ENDTOKEN
Was meant for me ENDTOKEN
Look what you did ENDTOKEN
Is this who you wanted me to be? ENDTOKEN
Well, it's not me ENDTOKEN
Look what you did ENDTOKEN
Is this how you wanted it to be? ENDTOKEN
This life you gave away ENDTOKEN
Was meant for me ENDTOKEN
I don't know how I can face this pain ENDTOKEN
I'll keep it inside so you can't see ENDTOKEN
I don't think I can go on this way ENDTOKEN
'Cause it's not me ENDTOKEN
I like your pants around your feet ENDTOKEN
And I like the dirt that's on your knees ENDTOKEN
And I like the way you still say please ENDTOKEN
While you're looking up at me ENDTOKEN
You're like my favourite damn disease ENDTOKEN
And I love the places that we go ENDTOKEN
And I love the people that you know ENDTOKEN
And I love the way you can't say no ENDTOKEN
Too many long lines in a row ENDTOKEN
I love the powder on your nose ENDTOKEN
And now I know who you are ENDTOKEN
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out ENDTOKEN
(Now I did, you wonder why) ENDTOKEN
And now I know who you are ENDTOKEN
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out ENDTOKEN
(Now I did, you wonder why) ENDTOKEN
I like the freckles on your chest ENDTOKEN
And I like the way you like me best ENDTOKEN
And I like the way you're not impressed ENDTOKEN
While you put me to the test ENDTOKEN
I like the white stains on your dress ENDTOKEN
And I love the way you pass the check ENDTOKEN
And I love the good times that you wreck ENDTOKEN
And I love your lack of self-respect ENDTOKEN
While you're passed out on the deck ENDTOKEN
I love my hands around your neck ENDTOKEN
And now I know who you are ENDTOKEN
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out ENDTOKEN
(Now I did, you wonder why) ENDTOKEN
And now I know who you are ENDTOKEN
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out ENDTOKEN
(Now I did, you wonder why) ENDTOKEN
(Why not before? You never tried) ENDTOKEN
(Gone for good, and this is it) ENDTOKEN
I like your pants around your feet ENDTOKEN
And I like the dirt that's on your knees ENDTOKEN
And I like the way you still say please ENDTOKEN
While you're looking up at me ENDTOKEN
You're like my favorite damn disease ENDTOKEN
And I hate the places that we go ENDTOKEN
And I hate the people that you know ENDTOKEN
And I hate the way you can't say no ENDTOKEN
Too many long lines in a row ENDTOKEN
I hate the powder on your nose ENDTOKEN
And now I know who you are ENDTOKEN
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out ENDTOKEN
(Now I did, you wonder why) ENDTOKEN
And now I know who you are ENDTOKEN
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out ENDTOKEN
(Now I did, you wonder why) ENDTOKEN
(Why not before? You never tried) ENDTOKEN
(Gone for good, and this is it) ENDTOKEN
Don't tell me what to think ENDTOKEN
'Cause I don't care this time ENDTOKEN
Don't tell me what to believe ENDTOKEN
'Cause you won't be there ENDTOKEN
To catch me when I fall ENDTOKEN
But you'll need me when I'm not here at all ENDTOKEN
Miss me when I'm gone again, yeah ENDTOKEN
I'm going down in flames ENDTOKEN
I'm falling into this again, yeah ENDTOKEN
I'm going down in flames ENDTOKEN
I'm falling into this again ENDTOKEN
Don't tell me how life is ENDTOKEN
'Cause I don't really want to know ENDTOKEN
Don't tell me how this game ends ENDTOKEN
'Cause we'll just see how it goes ENDTOKEN
Catch me when I fall ENDTOKEN
Or you'll need me when I'm not here at all ENDTOKEN
Miss me when I'm gone again, yeah ENDTOKEN
I'm going down in flames ENDTOKEN
I'm falling into this again, yeah ENDTOKEN
I'm going down in flames ENDTOKEN
I'm falling into this again ENDTOKEN
Now, I'm all the way down here ENDTOKEN
I'm falling ENDTOKEN
I'm all the way down here ENDTOKEN
I'm falling down again ENDTOKEN
I'm falling down ENDTOKEN
I'm falling down ENDTOKEN
I'm falling down ENDTOKEN
I'm going down in flames ENDTOKEN
I'm falling into this again, yeah ENDTOKEN
I'm going down in flames ENDTOKEN
I'm falling into this again ENDTOKEN
Now, I'm all the way down here ENDTOKEN
I'm falling ENDTOKEN
All the way ENDTOKEN
All the way down here ENDTOKEN
I'm falling down again ENDTOKEN
Now I'm falling down ENDTOKEN
Got your freedom now boy ENDTOKEN
Who do you serve? ENDTOKEN
Took for granted what you should have preserved ENDTOKEN
No time left, no time left ENDTOKEN
To make amends ENDTOKEN
Keep burning bridges while you're buying your new friends ENDTOKEN
A day of reflection hits, you're a shell ENDTOKEN
Skin and bones, counting costs ENDTOKEN
Is it worth your soul? ENDTOKEN
A day of reflection hits ENDTOKEN
It's funny how times can change ENDTOKEN
Rearrange and distance makes ENDTOKEN
The pain fade away ENDTOKEN
So important then, doesn't matter now ENDTOKEN
Both feet on the ground ENDTOKEN
Come full circle, yeah ENDTOKEN
Come full circle ENDTOKEN
No access granted now boy ENDTOKEN
You've been denied ENDTOKEN
Jump a fence to see what's on the other side ENDTOKEN
Are you wanted, are you wanted ENDTOKEN
The question is ENDTOKEN
Could second chances mean another impression? ENDTOKEN
A day of reflection hits, you're a shell ENDTOKEN
Skin and bones, counting costs ENDTOKEN
Is it worth your soul? ENDTOKEN
A day of reflection hits ENDTOKEN
It's funny how times can change ENDTOKEN
Rearrange and distance makes ENDTOKEN
The pain fade away ENDTOKEN
So important then, doesn't matter now ENDTOKEN
Both feet on the ground ENDTOKEN
Come full circle ENDTOKEN
We come full circle ENDTOKEN
I got one foot stuck in heaven, yeah ENDTOKEN
One boot stuck in hell ENDTOKEN
I looked at God, he winked at me ENDTOKEN
I made this mess myself ENDTOKEN
Don't be surprised and don't deny ENDTOKEN
Hear every word I say ENDTOKEN
Close the door and don't look back ENDTOKEN
Or you will fade away ENDTOKEN
It's funny how times can change ENDTOKEN
Rearrange and distance makes ENDTOKEN
The pain fade away ENDTOKEN
It's funny how times can change ENDTOKEN
Rearrange and distance makes ENDTOKEN
The pain fade away ENDTOKEN
So important then, doesn't matter now ENDTOKEN
Both feet on the ground ENDTOKEN
Come full circle ENDTOKEN
Full circle ENDTOKEN
Come full circle ENDTOKEN
We have come ENDTOKEN
Full circle ENDTOKEN
Hello my friend, we meet again ENDTOKEN
It's been a while, where should we begin? ENDTOKEN
Feels like forever ENDTOKEN
Within my heart are memories ENDTOKEN
Of perfect love that you gave to me ENDTOKEN
Oh I remember ENDTOKEN
When you are with me, I'm free ENDTOKEN
I'm careless, I believe ENDTOKEN
Above all the others, we'll fly ENDTOKEN
This brings tears to my eyes ENDTOKEN
My sacrifice ENDTOKEN
We've seen our share of ups and downs ENDTOKEN
Oh, how quickly life can turn around ENDTOKEN
In an instant ENDTOKEN
It feels so good to reunite ENDTOKEN
Within yourself and within your mind ENDTOKEN
Let's find peace there ENDTOKEN
Because when you are with me, I'm free ENDTOKEN
I'm careless, I believe ENDTOKEN
Above all the others, we'll fly ENDTOKEN
This brings tears to my eyes ENDTOKEN
My sacrifice ENDTOKEN
I just want to see you again ENDTOKEN
I just want to see you again ENDTOKEN
Because when you are with me, I'm free ENDTOKEN
I'm careless, I believe ENDTOKEN
Above all the others, we'll fly ENDTOKEN
This brings tears to my eyes ENDTOKEN
My sacrifice ENDTOKEN
Because when you are with me, I'm free ENDTOKEN
I'm careless, I believe ENDTOKEN
Above all the others, we'll fly ENDTOKEN
This brings tears to my eyes ENDTOKEN
My sacrifice ENDTOKEN
I just want to say hello again ENDTOKEN
I just want to say hello again ENDTOKEN
I just want to say hello again ENDTOKEN
My sacrifice ENDTOKEN
Say goodbye to all my troubles ENDTOKEN
Say goodbye to this ENDTOKEN
I'm saying goodbye to all the desperation I've lived in ENDTOKEN
It doesn't hurt to talk about it ENDTOKEN
It sometimes helps me through ENDTOKEN
Now there's nothing left to talk about ENDTOKEN
I'll tell you... ENDTOKEN
Now it's time to say goodbye ENDTOKEN
I've been living this lie for way to long ENDTOKEN
I can't handle this life got to say goodbye ENDTOKEN
I've been living this lie for way to long ENDTOKEN
Blame it on this way of thinking ENDTOKEN
Blame it on someone ENDTOKEN
There's no answers only questions that have come undone ENDTOKEN
It doesn't help to think about it ENDTOKEN
It only makes me feel used ENDTOKEN
Now there's nothing left to think about ENDTOKEN
Nothing's true... ENDTOKEN
I've been living this lie for way to long ENDTOKEN
I can't handle this life got to say goodbye ENDTOKEN
I've been living this lie for way to long ENDTOKEN
I wish that we could do this all again ENDTOKEN
I wish that I could stay but I can't ENDTOKEN
And now it's time to leave this all behind ENDTOKEN
Of all the things to say we said goodbye ENDTOKEN
I can't handle this life ENDTOKEN
I can't handle this life ENDTOKEN
I can't handle this life ENDTOKEN
I'm dead ENDTOKEN
He's drunk again, it's time to fight ENDTOKEN
She must have done something wrong tonight ENDTOKEN
The living room becomes a boxing ring ENDTOKEN
It's time to run when you see him ENDTOKEN
Clenching his hands ENDTOKEN
She's just a woman ENDTOKEN
Never again ENDTOKEN
I hear her scream, from down the hall ENDTOKEN
Amazing she can even talk at all ENDTOKEN
She cries to me "Go back to bed" ENDTOKEN
I'm terrified that she'll wind up ENDTOKEN
Dead in his hands ENDTOKEN
She's just a woman ENDTOKEN
Never again ENDTOKEN
Been there before, but not like this ENDTOKEN
Seen it before, but not like this ENDTOKEN
Never before have I ever ENDTOKEN

(Hiding hate that burns inside) ENDTOKEN
(Which only fuels their selfish pride) ENDTOKEN
And I said ohhhhhhh ENDTOKEN
(All held captive, out from the sun) ENDTOKEN
(A sun that shines on only some) ENDTOKEN
(We the meek are all in one) ENDTOKEN
I hear a thunder in the distance ENDTOKEN
See a vision of a cross ENDTOKEN
I feel the pain that was given ENDTOKEN
On that sad day of loss ENDTOKEN
A lion roars in the darkness ENDTOKEN
Only he holds the key ENDTOKEN
A light to free me from my burden ENDTOKEN
And grant me life eternally ENDTOKEN

Looking back at the beginning of this ENDTOKEN
And how life was ENDTOKEN
Just you and me lovin' all of our friends ENDTOKEN
Living life like an ocean ENDTOKEN
But now the current's only pulling me down ENDTOKEN
It’s getting harder to breathe ENDTOKEN
It won’t be too long and I'll be going under ENDTOKEN
Can you save me from this? ENDTOKEN
'Cause it’s not my time, I'm not going ENDTOKEN
There's a fear in me, it’s not showing ENDTOKEN
This could be the end of me ENDTOKEN
And everything I know ENDTOKEN
Ooh, but I won’t go ENDTOKEN
I look ahead to all the plans that we made ENDTOKEN
And the dreams that we had ENDTOKEN
I'm in a world that tries to take them away ENDTOKEN
Oh, but I'm taking them back ENDTOKEN
'Cause all of this time I've just been too blind to understand ENDTOKEN
What should matter to me ENDTOKEN
My friend, this life we live, it's not what we have ENDTOKEN
It's what we believe in ENDTOKEN
It's not my time, I'm not going ENDTOKEN
There's a fear in me, but it's not showing ENDTOKEN
This could be the end of me ENDTOKEN
And everything I know ENDTOKEN

Well, I know the feeling ENDTOKEN
Of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge ENDTOKEN
And there ain't no healing ENDTOKEN
From cutting yourself with the jagged edge ENDTOKEN
I'm telling you that, it's never that bad ENDTOKEN
Take it from someone who's been where you're at ENDTOKEN
Laid out on the floor ENDTOKEN
And you're not sure you can take this anymore ENDTOKEN
So just give it one more try to a lullaby ENDTOKEN
And turn this up on the radio ENDTOKEN
If you can hear me now ENDTOKEN
I'm reaching out ENDTOKEN
To let you know that you're not alone ENDTOKEN
And if you can't tell, I'm scared as hell ENDTOKEN
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone ENDTOKEN
So just close your eyes ENDTOKEN
Oh, honey, here comes a lullaby ENDTOKEN
Your very own lullaby ENDTOKEN
Please let me take you ENDTOKEN
Out of the darkness and into the light ENDTOKEN
'Cause I have faith in you ENDTOKEN
That you're gonna make it through another night ENDTOKEN

Tell your friends not to think out loud until they swallow ENDTOKEN
Whisper things into my brain, your voice sounds so hollow ENDTOKEN
I am not a leader of men since I prefer to follow ENDTOKEN
Do you think I could have a drink since it's so hard to swallow ENDTOKEN
Yeah, so hard to swallow ENDTOKEN
Turn your television off and I will sing a song ENDTOKEN

Hands on a window pane ENDTOKEN
Watching some children laugh and play ENDTOKEN

So let the children play ENDTOKEN
Inside your heart always ENDTOKEN
And death you will defy ENDTOKEN
Because your youth will never die ENDTOKEN
Never die ENDTOKEN
In searching for substance ENDTOKEN
We're clouded by struggle's haze ENDTOKEN

Of youth's timeless maze ENDTOKEN

Your youth will never fade ENDTOKEN
So let the children play ENDTOKEN
Inside your heart always ENDTOKEN
And death you will defy ENDTOKEN
Because your youth will never die ENDTOKEN
Never die ENDTOKEN

I did what I did, can't say "hey man, I'm just a kid." ENDTOKEN
Saw the lie in my eyes, couldn't hide it ENDTOKEN
Cause she tasted like home ENDTOKEN
Yeah, she tasted like home ENDTOKEN
Oh ENDTOKEN
Well, home ain't what I'd call it ENDTOKEN
When I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways ENDTOKEN
The pain gets so much clearer ENDTOKEN
When the one to blame is standing in the mirror ENDTOKEN
This fool, this liar ENDTOKEN
Lit a match and set his life on fire ENDTOKEN
I guess I'd rather be alone, in a house that's not a home ENDTOKEN
The pain in my heart's 'cause we're a thousand miles apart ENDTOKEN
I've got no one to blame for the shame ENDTOKEN
'Cause she's waiting back home ENDTOKEN
I hope she's waiting back home ENDTOKEN
Stupid to think that I could blame it on the drink ENDTOKEN
Now I'm trying to stall, making calls to someone back home ENDTOKEN
I hope there's someone back home ENDTOKEN
Oh ENDTOKEN
Well, home ain't what I'd call it ENDTOKEN
When I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways ENDTOKEN
The pain gets so much clearer ENDTOKEN
When the one to blame is standing in the mirror ENDTOKEN
This fool, this liar ENDTOKEN
Lit a match and set his life on fire ENDTOKEN
I guess I'd rather be alone, in a house that's not a home ENDTOKEN
I walk through the door and there's no light on anymore ENDTOKEN
Must have known all along I was wrong ENDTOKEN
Cause there's no one at home ENDTOKEN
No one's waiting back home ENDTOKEN
Well, home ain't what I'd call it ENDTOKEN
When I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways ENDTOKEN
The pain gets so much clearer ENDTOKEN
When the one to blame is standing in the mirror ENDTOKEN
This fool, this liar ENDTOKEN
Lit a match and set his life on fire ENDTOKEN
I guess I'd rather be alone, in a house that's not a home ENDTOKEN
She said life's a lot to think about sometimes ENDTOKEN
When you're living in between the lines ENDTOKEN
And all the stars they sparkle and shine everyday ENDTOKEN
He said life's so hard to move in sometimes ENDTOKEN
When it feels like I'm towin' the line ENDTOKEN
And no one even cares to ask me why I feel this way ENDTOKEN
And I know you feel helpless now and I know you feel alone ENDTOKEN
Well, that's the same road, the same road that I am on ENDTOKEN
He said life's a lot to think about sometimes ENDTOKEN
When you keep it all between the lines ENDTOKEN
Of everything I want and I want to find, one of these days ENDTOKEN
Yeah ENDTOKEN
What you thought was real in life somehow steered you wrong ENDTOKEN
Now you just keep drivin', tryin' to find out where you belong ENDTOKEN
And I know you feel helpless now and I know you feel alone ENDTOKEN
Well, that's the same road, the same road that I am on ENDTOKEN
What you thought was real in life somehow steered you wrong ENDTOKEN
Now you just keep drivin', tryin' to find out where you belong ENDTOKEN
And I know you feel helpless now and I know you feel alone ENDTOKEN
Well, that's the same road, the same road that I am on ENDTOKEN
Put me on a train mama ENDTOKEN
This place just ain't the same no more ENDTOKEN
Put me on a train mama ENDTOKEN
I'm leavin' today ENDTOKEN
I don't wanna watch the world spinnin' ENDTOKEN
I wanna be spinnin' with it ENDTOKEN
Put me on a train mama ENDTOKEN
I'm leavin' today ENDTOKEN
'Cause I got the fever, that's for sure ENDTOKEN
And knowin' I can get it makes me want it more ENDTOKEN
Mama, I just want you to know that I'm gonna be fine ENDTOKEN
Lord, I know it's the chance that I take ENDTOKEN
But I know you've forgiven the mistakes that I've made ENDTOKEN
There's a life out there and it's gonna be mine ENDTOKEN
Put me on a train mama ENDTOKEN
'Cause I can't take this pain no more ENDTOKEN
Put me on a train mama ENDTOKEN
I'm leavin' today ENDTOKEN
And there's a world that's out there waiting ENDTOKEN
And I know that it's the chance I'm taking ENDTOKEN
Put me on a train mama ENDTOKEN
I'm leavin' today ENDTOKEN
'Cause I got the fever, that's for sure ENDTOKEN
And knowin' I can get it makes me want it more ENDTOKEN
Mama, I just want you to know that I'm gonna be fine ENDTOKEN
Lord, I know it's the chance that I take ENDTOKEN
But I know you've forgiven the mistakes that I've made ENDTOKEN
There's a life out there and it's gonna be mine ENDTOKEN
God knows how long I'll be gone ENDTOKEN
But maybe one day a train will bring me home ENDTOKEN
Put me on a train mama ENDTOKEN
Put me on a train mama ENDTOKEN
Oh, put me on a train mama ENDTOKEN
I'm leavin' today ENDTOKEN
'Cause I got the fever, that's for sure ENDTOKEN

But I know you've forgiven the mistakes that I've made ENDTOKEN
There's a life out there and it's gonna be mine ENDTOKEN
Oh, put me on the train ENDTOKEN
'Cause I'm leaving today ENDTOKEN
I wanted to find somewhere to hide ENDTOKEN
And I opened up and left those fears inside ENDTOKEN
And I wanted to be anyone else ENDTOKEN
Only to find that there was no one there but me ENDTOKEN
But I woke up to the real life ENDTOKEN
And I realized it's not worth running from anymore ENDTOKEN
When there was nowhere left to hide I found out ENDTOKEN
That nothing's real here, but I won't stop now until I find a better part of me ENDTOKEN
I let those hard days get me down ENDTOKEN
And all the things I hate got in my way ENDTOKEN
I could've screamed without a sound ENDTOKEN
I found myself silenced by those things they say ENDTOKEN
But I woke up to the real life ENDTOKEN
And I realized it's not worth running from anymore ENDTOKEN
When there was nowhere left to hide I found out ENDTOKEN
That nothing's real here, but I won't stop now until I find a better part of me ENDTOKEN
That's out there somewhere ENDTOKEN
And it can't be that far away ENDTOKEN
That's where I'll find myself ENDTOKEN
And I'll find my way out ENDTOKEN
That's where I'll find out ENDTOKEN
But I woke up to the real life ENDTOKEN
And I realized it's not worth running from anymore ENDTOKEN
When there was nowhere left to hide I found out ENDTOKEN
That nothing's real here, but I won't stop now until I find a better part of me ENDTOKEN
Take away from me ENDTOKEN
That what you just gave ENDTOKEN
Nothing left to heal ENDTOKEN
Nothing left to save ENDTOKEN
Given half a chance ENDTOKEN
Given what we've spent ENDTOKEN
I will not repay ENDTOKEN
I will not repent ENDTOKEN
I don't wanna leave ENDTOKEN
I don't wanna stay ENDTOKEN
Get away from me ENDTOKEN
Stay the hell away ENDTOKEN
And I will give up my mind ENDTOKEN
And I will give my way ENDTOKEN
And I will pluck out my eyes ENDTOKEN
Yes, I will feel my way ENDTOKEN
Yes, I will ENDTOKEN
Is there something wrong ENDTOKEN
With the way I feel? ENDTOKEN
I don't wana beg ENDTOKEN
I don't have to steal ENDTOKEN
Let me prove myself ENDTOKEN
Let me earn your trust ENDTOKEN
Let me betray ENDTOKEN
The way that we discussed ENDTOKEN
I don't wanna thieve ENDTOKEN
I don't wanna snatch ENDTOKEN
Get away from me ENDTOKEN
Stay the hell away ENDTOKEN
And I will give up my mind ENDTOKEN
And I will give my way ENDTOKEN
And I will pluck out my eyes ENDTOKEN
Yes, I will feel my way ENDTOKEN
Yes, I will ENDTOKEN
In open hand, unopened gift ENDTOKEN
Her broken bones, her head won't lift ENDTOKEN
A decade since you've been gone ENDTOKEN
Mend the cracks and say so long ENDTOKEN
Say so long ENDTOKEN
Take away from me ENDTOKEN
That what you just gave ENDTOKEN
Nothing left to heal ENDTOKEN
Nothing left to save ENDTOKEN
Given half a chance ENDTOKEN
Given what we've spent ENDTOKEN
I will not repay ENDTOKEN
I will not repent ENDTOKEN
And I will give up my mind ENDTOKEN
And I will give my way ENDTOKEN
And I will pluck out my eyes ENDTOKEN
Yes, I will feel my way ENDTOKEN
I will ENDTOKEN
Yes, I will ENDTOKEN
