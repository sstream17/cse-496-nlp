        "This paean to romantic ambivalence is the fifth single from Nickelback’s seventh studio album, Here and Now.",
        "The song’s music video stars Jason Alexander (George Costanza from TV sitcom Seinfeld) as a coffee shop barista who falls in love with a beautiful girl played by Brooke Burns (Jessie Owens from TV series Baywatch) and attempts to woo her with his caffeinated creations. Alexander previously featured in a couple of visuals for Brad Paisley songs, “Celebrity” and “Online,” the latter of which he also directed and won the 2007 Country Music Association’s Video of the Year Award."
