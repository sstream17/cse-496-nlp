        "Frontman and lyricist Chad Kroeger told MTV News that this acoustic, rootsy flavored track was inspired by his own life experiences. He explained: “It’s a good rock-and-roll version of [Garth Brooks'] ‘Friends In Low Places.'Anyone who’s ever had roommates, or more than a couple, will relate to this song. I used to have four roommates. We all lived in this house. It was a bunch of drunken kids, barely getting by, trying to find money for beer. Food was low on the priority list. So it’s a song about trying to get by and having the best times – ever.”",
        "Bassist Mike Kroeger commented on the record company’s website regarding this Country influenced tune: “It’s a big-time part of our background, that whole laid-back, barroom kind of feel. Where we grew up everybody listened to Country.”"
