        "Flo Rida guests on this Latin-tinged funkathon. Asked by Yahoo! Music how he got the rapper to come on board, frontman Chad Kroeger replied: “A friend of mine who was working on some of the tunes was also working on his record and played our record for him. He asked if he could rap on the song. And we were flattered.”",
        "“He came over and wrote the rap and rapped away,” Kroeger continued. “He’s impressive. He’s talented.” “We’ve never done that before,” he added. “It’s always high on my priority list to try something we’ve never done before. The song is very funky and it’s a different approach for us, so that left-hand turn made the rapping all the more appealing.”",
        "Chad Kroeger explained to Jam! Music why they took this in a different direction to Nickelback’s usual rock sound. “We’ve kind of been trying to get a little bit heavier and more melodic and go in more directions with each record,” said the singer. “And then we just kind of got to a point where, ‘Well, we can’t really get any heavier so what do you want to do? What should we try now?’ Then it was just like, ‘Well, why don’t we try something a little bit funky?’”",
        "“At one point the song is reaching a stage where you could really hear everything that was going on and our engineer-slash-producer that’s been working on this whole record with us, his name is Chris Baseford, we looked at each other and just went, ‘Horns. Let’s get some horns,’” he continued. “So we hired the guys that did Michael Jackson’s Thriller and got ‘em in there and hired some ladies to do some singing on it and the next thing you know Flo Rida’s rapping on it. And all of a sudden it’s like, 'Alright, THIS is a left turn.’”"
