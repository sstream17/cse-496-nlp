    "Comments": [
        "Act III of “The Betrayal” is the eighth track in this Nickelback album, and the act portrayed lyrically and through more of a grittier tone. Surprisingly, there lacks an Act II for this piece; frontman Chad Kroeger has stated that it would be set for release in a later album, as it may contrast the tone generally portrayed in the current album itself.",
        "Although it is never directly mentioned, multiple allusions to the Biblical story of the Last Supper and the events that followed, eventually leading to the death of Jesus Christ, are present in this song."
