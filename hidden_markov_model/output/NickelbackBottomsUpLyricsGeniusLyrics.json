        "Frontman Chad Kroeger told Nekesa Mumbi Moody of the Associated Press: “When you listen to this record, it sounds like it could be from four different artists. We always try and do the same thing: We try to do something heavier than we’ve ever done, more melodic than we’ve ever done, every single time we do this, and I think we’ve achieved it again.I think we’ve tried new things and explored new ideas, and I like it when people hear the songs and people say, ‘This doesn’t sound like Nickelback, this sounds like something different for you guys.’”"
