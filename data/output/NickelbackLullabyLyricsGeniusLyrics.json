        "This sweet tempered Country-tinged ballad was penned by Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger with Nashville songwriters Chris Tomkins (Carrie Underwood’s “Before He Cheats”), Craig Wiseman (Blake Shelton’s “Hillbilly Bone”) and Rodney Clawson (George Strait’s “I Saw God Today”).",
        "The song is based on an experience in Chad and Mike Kroeger’s childhood when they found their babysitter crying her eyes out as her boyfriend had died in a motorcycle accident."
