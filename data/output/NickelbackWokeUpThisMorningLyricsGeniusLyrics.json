        "Chad Kroeger of Nickelback wrote this song about his grandmother’s funeral. Said Kroeger: “I was just really unimpressed with the way the whole funeral took place. I felt it could have been handled a lot better. It was in this really small town where she met my grandfather and they started the family.”",
        "Kroeger added that after the funeral he had to return to an unhealthy relationship with his girlfriend Jodi, who he wrote the hit “How You Remind Me” about. Said Kroeger: “The whole thing’s about a month in my life when I felt like s–t when I woke up in the morning.”"
