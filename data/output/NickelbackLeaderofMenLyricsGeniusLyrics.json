        "This was Nickelback’s first single released on a major label. They had received some exposure from earlier independent releases, but this was their big breakthrough single.",
        "This got plenty of exposure in their home country of Canada due to Canadian Content regulations. That’s a policy of ensuring that 35% of everything on the radio in Canada comes from Canadian artists. It helped make room for them.",
        "The lyrics are an amalgam of experiences frontman Chad Kroeger has had. He describes what it’s like being on magic mushrooms, but also one time when he had to save a friend from drowning."
