        "This song finds Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger detailing a robbery-gone-stupid. Speaking to Loudwire, Kroeger said about the track: “I’ve always wanted to write a song about a bank robbery. If I couldn’t be involved in a bank robbery, I gotta write a good one. My band members still haven’t figured out that this is a metaphor from an instance early on in my life.”"
