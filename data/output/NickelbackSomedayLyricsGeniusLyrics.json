        "The lyrics of “Someday” chronicle a lost promise; the singer talks about how a relationship failed and he wonders “how the hell’d we wind up like this”. He wishes that they could discuss their issues and that the relationship will come back someday, but that someday never comes.",
        "“Someday” has reached #1 (where it stayed for three weeks) in Canada and #7 in the United States.",
        "Yes, a second version of the music video with an alternate ending exists."
