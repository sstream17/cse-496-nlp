    "Comments": [
        "There’s a rumor that says that this song was written by Chad Kroeger about his breakup with his ex wife Avril Lavigne.",
        "Per a press release, frontman Chad Kroeger talked about the inspiration about “Song on Fire”.",
        "As we were working on this song, a very personal one for me, we all instantly connected to it on different levels through our own personal experiences. Everyone has a need to love or be loved and we’ve all been hurt or felt loss.  It’s about your heart yearning for something that your rational mind knows is impossible to hold on to. There is a universally, haunting finality to losing love and we found ‘our protagonist’ (in this song) trying to reclaim it; but not knowing where to begin or that it might ultimately be in vain."
